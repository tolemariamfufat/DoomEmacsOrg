* Top 5 ICT Concepts
** Liquidity
** Dealing Range
** Fair Value Gap
** PD Array
** The Power of 3 (Consolidation, Manipulation and Distribution)
* PD Array
*** Old High or low
*** Rejection block
*** Order block
*** Fair value gap
*** Liquidity void
*** Breaker block
*** Mitigation block
*** Suspension Block
*** Long wicks
* ICT Market Structure and Intraweek Reversals
** Intraweek Market Reversals
*** Fast Moves Early in the Week (Mon–Tue)
*** If price runs aggressively on Monday/Tuesday, it often exhausts liquidity early.
*** This usually leads to a reversal midweek, so don’t assume early-week momentum will continue.
*** Midweek Reversal (Wed–Thu)
*** Historically, Wednesday and Thursday often produce monthly or weekly turning points.
*** These days mark when the market shifts away from the earlier move, hunting liquidity in the opposite direction.
** Internal Range Liquidity & Market Structure Shift (MSS)
*** Liquidity Sweeps Trigger MSS
*** When old highs’ buy stops or lows’ sell stops are taken, it signals a Market Structure Shift (MSS).
*** Impact on Order Blocks
**** An MSS invalidates previous order blocks (e.g., higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows).
**** Since order blocks reflect a change in price delivery, they align with MSS events.
** Intraday Order Flow & Daily Range (S&P 500 Example)
*** Trading Sessions
*** Active ranges:
**** 8:30 – 12:00 pm (NY time) → Morning session.
**** 1:00 – 4:30 pm → Afternoon session.
**** 12:00 – 1:00 pm (Lunch) → Low volume, best to avoid trading.
** Market Structure Hierarchy
*** Long-Term High/Low (LTH/LTL)
*** Higher-timeframe framework Sets the overall directional bias.
*** Intermediate-Term High/Low (ITH/ITL): Acts to rebalance Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) within the long-term range.
**** Two types:
***** Strong Market → Short-term highs/lows appear below the ITH/ITL (shows continuation strength).
***** Weak Market → Short-term highs/lows appear above the ITH/ITL (shows likely reversal).
*** Short-Term High/Low (STH/STL): Often associated with failed or resisted order blocks. These are tactical levels where liquidity gets taken.
** Key Takeaways
*** Early-week speed often traps traders; midweek is when reversals form.
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS) occurs when liquidity at old highs/lows is taken, often invalidating prior order blocks.
*** S&P 500 intraday has two main tradable sessions (morning and afternoon).
*** Structure exists in layers (long-term → intermediate → short-term), with intermediate highs/lows showing the strength or weakness of trend.
* Institutional order flow
** The Core Idea
*** IOF = the direction institutions are delivering price.
*** It’s read by watching how price reacts around imbalances and opposite-color candles.
*** If price respects those “institutional footprints,” order flow is intact.
*** If those structures break, the order flow is violated → don’t trade.
** Bearish Institutional Order Flow
*** In a bearish environment:
**** Market leaves imbalances (FVGs) to the downside.
**** When price retraces to rebalance those imbalances, the highs formed during that retrace should not be broken higher.
**** All up-close candles in the swing act as resistance order blocks.
**** If price trades above those up-close candles, IOF is broken → bias is invalid.
**  Bullish Institutional Order Flow
*** In a bullish environment:
**** Market leaves imbalances (FVGs) to the upside.
**** Price retraces into the imbalance and should respect the down-close candles (bullish OBs).
**** These down-close candles act as support structures.
**** If price cuts below these candles, it invalidates the order flow unless there’s a nearby swing low that must be cleared first (a sell-side liquidity raid).
* ICT Setup Model (2022 Mentorship)
** Time & Anchor Points
*** Midnight Open (00:00 EST/NY time) → reference anchor.
*** 8:30 AM Open (EST/NY time) → reference anchor.
*** Compare these two opens:
**** Bullish bias: Midnight open above 8:30 open → market is in discount → good for buys.
**** Bearish bias: Midnight open below 8:30 open → market is in premium → good for sells.
**** Note: This setup repeats weekly in Forex (less in bonds/indices).
** Premium / Discount Logic
*** Sell only in premium (above equilibrium).
*** Buy only in discount (below equilibrium).
*** Never flip the rule → that’s how you avoid unnecessary losses.
** Price Action Filtering
*** You need a liquidity run first:
**** Bearish case:
***** Price runs above relative equal highs (old high).
***** Then displaces lower and breaks a short-term low.
***** That’s your confirmation.
**** Bullish case:
***** Price runs below relative equal lows (old low).
***** Then displaces higher and breaks a short-term high.
***** That’s your confirmation.
***** No displacement through a short-term high/low = no valid setup.
** Execution Rule
**** Entry must be on a Fair Value Gap (FVG) in the displacement leg.
***** Stop placement:
***** Daily → Hourly → 15M → 5M → 1M.
***** There will always be an FVG at some fractal level.
** Trade Management
*** Target: levels of liquidity (equal highs, equal lows, or imbalance fills).
*** Divide the move into levels (partials can be taken at each).
*** Follow strict model → if setup breaks (order flow invalid), do not trade.
** Core Principle (Foundation): a setup requires two conditions:
*** Liquidity Run
***** The market doesn’t move randomly; it seeks liquidity.
***** Liquidity usually rests above old highs (buy stops) or below old lows (sell stops).
***** A “liquidity run” means price has reached above a prior high or below a prior low, triggering stop orders.
*** Displacement + Break of Short-Term Structure
**** Displacement = a strong, impulsive move in one direction (fast, wide-bodied candles). It shows intent by “smart money.”
**** After displacement, you want to see a short-term structure break:
**** If liquidity was swept above highs, you want to see a sharp move down breaking a recent low → bearish setup.
**** If liquidity was swept below lows, you want to see a sharp move up breaking a recent high → bullish setup.
**** This structure break confirms the liquidity grab wasn’t just a continuation but the start of a reversal.
* ICT Counter-Trend Context Model
** Big Picture (Higher Time frame Bias)
*** Start with the higher time frame (Daily or 4H).
*** Confirm the market is in a long-term bearish move (downtrend).
*** A counter-trend setup = looking for short-term bullish retracement trades inside that bearish trend.
** Define the Objective (Draw on Liquidity)
*** A counter-trend trade must aim for a clear liquidity pool above current price.
**** Examples:
***** Relative equal highs.
***** A clean swing high.
***** A daily imbalance or order block.
***** If there is no higher-time frame liquidity target, do not take a counter-trend trade.
**  Wait for Discount Retracement Zone
*** Drop into lower time frames (1H, 15M).
*** Watch for price to retrace into a discount area of the short-term range.
*** In that discount zone, look for:
*** Fair Value Gap (FVG).
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS) → break of short-term high.
*** Down-close order block acting as support.
**  Execution Logic
*** Entry: in the FVG or OB inside the discount zone.
*** Stop loss: below the short-term low.
*** Target: the higher-timeframe liquidity (your Draw on Liquidity).
**  Patience Rule
*** If price runs impulsively to the objective (liquidity) without retracing into your discount entry zone →
*** ❌ No trade.
*** Only enter when ICT rules align.
**  Time of Day Context
*** New York Lunch (11:30 AM – 1:30 PM NY time):
*** Market often prints equal highs during this slow period.
*** In counter-trend context, price may later rally through those equal highs as it seeks the higher-timeframe liquidity.
** Summary
*** Counter-trend = trading retracements against the big bias.
*** Must have:
**** Higher-timeframe bearish context.
**** A clear liquidity target (draw on liquidity).
**** Discount zone + FVG + MSS on lower timeframe for entry.
**** Discipline to wait if no retracement forms.
**** Awareness of NY Lunch equal highs as staging areas for liquidity runs.
* When to buy
** ICT advises "buy on Wednesday on New York session".
** Pay attention to Accumulation, Manipulation (creating low/high of the day), distribution (expansion); that is power of AMD!
* Narrative (Precise Explanation)
** Definition: Narrative is the logical expectation of where price is likely to go, based on liquidity and price action — not indicators. It answers: “Where is the draw on liquidity?”
** Validation: A narrative is proven when price behavior confirms the logic (e.g., sweeping liquidity, respecting a fair value gap, or shifting structure).
** Process:
*** Identify higher-timeframe levels (e.g., 15M fair value gaps).
*** Watch how price reacts when it trades into those areas.
*** Drop to a lower timeframe (e.g., 5M) to refine entries once structure shifts or imbalances rebalance.
*** Track the sequence: accumulation → manipulation → distribution.
** Key Principle: Always align lower-timeframe trading with higher-timeframe context; otherwise, you’re trading blindly.
*** Example (Bullish Scenario):
*** Midnight opens higher than 8:30.
*** Price rallies into the morning, retraces before lunch, then rallies again in the afternoon targeting the previous day’s high.
** Key takeaway: Narrative is about reading price behavior logically across timeframes to anticipate liquidity draws, not relying on indicators or static support/resistance.
* T.G.I.F. Setup (ICT Concept)
** Meaning: “Thank God It’s Friday” setup — a pattern unique to Friday trading behavior.
** Core Idea: After a strong directional move during the week, Friday often delivers a weekly retracement.
** Retracement Target: Typically returns to 20%–30% of the weekly range.
** Context:
*** Best observed when price has already reached a higher timeframe objective (e.g., premium/discount zones).
*** Confluence often comes from Judas Swings (false moves) and Market Structure Shifts (MSS) on intraday charts.
*** Timing: Commonly plays out in the New York afternoon session, when profit-taking occurs.
** Key takeaway: The T.G.I.F. setup uses Friday’s tendency for retracement to capture a reversal or pullback after the week’s main move, especially when aligned with higher-timeframe objectives.
* Time and Price
** Price is delivered by an algorism; there is no buying or selling pressure.
** Algorithmic theory is based on Time and Price.
** Price levels are useless until time is considered.
** Time is of no use unless price is at a key PD array.
** Blending the two yields astonishing results & precision. 
* Key to Daily Bias
** Every day bias is unrealistic;
** Determine the likely weekly expansion;
** Look for obvious liquidity in that direction;
** Identify imbalances 
** Focus on the high or medium calendar event dates;
** Look for directional price runs in my kill zones intraday.
** You do not have trade every single day, there are days when you cannot trade. 
* Algo
** The Algo will not allow price to drop under a FVG as it tracts the buy side liquidity which has been already taken. The price action movement is not determined by supply demand or support Resistance, it is determined by Algo. 
* London Session (ICT perspective) – Simplified
*** Best Pairs: EUR & GBP, since they’re most active in London.
*** Key Time (ICT Kill Zone): 2:00 am – 5:00 am New York time.
*** Market Behavior:
**** London often sets either the High of the Day (if daily trend is bearish) or the Low of the Day (if daily trend is bullish).
**** Price may initially sweep one side (drop then rally, or rally then drop) to form liquidity, then reverse in the direction of the day’s bias.
*** Scalping Opportunity: Frequently offers 25–50 pip setups around London Open.
*** Daily Bias Connection:
**** If the daily trend is bullish, expect London to post the Low of the Day.
**** If the daily trend is bearish, expect London to post the High of the Day.
**** Range Formation: Comparing the London low with the following swing (New York session) often defines the day’s trading range.
**** Applicability: The same behavior shows up across FX, crypto, indices, commodities, and bonds.
*** Key takeaway: The London session has the highest probability of forming the day’s high or low, making it a prime opportunity to align with the daily bias and capture large portions of the daily range.
* ICT Price & Time Grid Cheat Sheet
** Price Action Grid (Where Liquidity Sits)
*** Old Highs → Buy stops above (liquidity).
*** Old Lows → Sell stops below (liquidity).
*** Liquidity Run → First raid is fake-out, second raid shows true direction.
*** Displacement → Strong break of structure confirms bias.
*** Order Blocks (OBs) → Last opposing candle before displacement (entry zones).
*** Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) → Imbalances where price often returns for entries.
➡ Sequence: Liquidity → Sweep → Displacement → OB / FVG → Expansion.
**  Time Grid (When Liquidity Gets Taken)
*** Daily Cycle
****  Asian Range (00:00–05:00 GMT)
Market consolidates, builds liquidity.
****  London Killzone (07:00–10:00 GMT / 02:00–05:00 EST)
Stop hunts: often takes Asia’s high/low.
****  New York AM (12:00–15:00 GMT / 07:00–10:00 EST)
Main move of the day, displacement + setups.
****  New York PM (17:00–19:00 GMT / 12:00–14:00 EST)
Reversal or continuation into close.
*** Weekly Cycle
**** Mon–Tue → Weekly high or low often forms.
**** Wed–Thu → Expansion in real direction.
**** Fri → Profit taking, reversals, consolidation.
***  How to Combine Them
**** Step 1: Mark old highs & lows (yesterday’s, weekly, Asia session).
**** Step 2: Wait for liquidity run during killzones (London & NY).
**** Step 3: Identify which liquidity gets swept first (old high or old low).
**** Step 4: Confirm with displacement in opposite direction.
**** Step 5: Enter on retrace to OB or FVG in killzone.
* Criterion to determine bias
=> Below is a practical, step-by-step workflow you can run on any chart to determine bias using the ICT idea that opposite-color candles become support/resistance (i.e. order blocks). Follow this exactly on your chart and you’ll get consistent, repeatable reads.
**  Pick your timeframes
*** Higher timeframe (HTF) = trend anchor (4H / Daily).
*** Lower timeframe (LTF) = entries and order-block validation (1H / 15m).
*** Always require HTF and LTF alignment: if HTF is bullish, prefer bullish setups on LTF.
**  Define the current structure (swing high / swing low)
*** Mark the most recent swing high and most recent swing low on the HTF.
*** Ask: did structure break to new highs (higher highs / higher lows) or new lows (lower lows / lower highs)? That tells you the initial directional tilt.
**  Measure candle-color dominance (quick bias heuristic)
*** On the swing (from swing low → swing high or vice versa), count the closes of the candles:
*** If majority are up-close candles (close > open) → bullish tilt.
*** If majority are down-close candles (close < open) → bearish tilt.
*** Give extra weight if those same-direction candles have bigger bodies and break structure (displacement).
*** Rule of thumb: majority over the last 8–12 candles in the swing; if 60%+ same color and structure is in that direction, bias leans that way.
**  Identify the opposite-color candles (the order blocks)
*** In a bullish swing: find the last down-close candle(s) immediately before the strong bullish displacement. That is a bullish Order Block (OB) — mark the full range (high → low) of that candle (or cluster if multiple).
*** In a bearish swing: find the last up-close candle(s) immediately before the strong bearish displacement. That is a bearish OB — mark its full range.
*** Prefer clean single-candle OBs (no overlap by later candles). If there is a cluster of 2–3 opposite candles before the run, you can mark the cluster as the zone.
**  Mark nearby Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) & liquidity
*** Draw any FVGs left by the displacement — these are additional magnet zones.
*** Mark obvious liquidity above old highs and below old lows (these explain temporary violations).
**  The validation test — what “shouldn’t be violated” means
*** Bullish scenario: price retraces into the down-close OB/FVG. The low created as it rebalances (the retracement low inside the OB/FVG) should not be closed below by price if bias remains bullish. If price closes below that low with meaningful displacement, the bullish bias is suspect/invalid.
*** Bearish scenario: price retraces into the up-close OB/FVG. The high formed in that rebalance should not be closed above by price if bias remains bearish. A clean close above that high invalidates the bearish bias.
*** In short: the retracement high (for bearish reads) or retracement low (for bullish reads) is the “line in the sand.”
**  How to watch for acceptable exceptions (liquidity grabs)
*** A temporary violation of the OB is allowed if:
*** It’s a quick wick / spike that reaches a nearby swing high/low to grab stops, and
*** Price reclaims the OB quickly (e.g., within a few candles and without a strong follow-through that breaks structure).
*** If the violation is followed by continued closes beyond the OB and structure breaks, treat it as bias invalidation.
** Entries, stops, and confirmation rules
*** Entry (bullish): wait for price to retrace into the bullish OB/FVG and show a bullish rejection candle (e.g., bullish engulf, strong close back above OB, or long lower wick + bullish close). Place entry on the close above the confirmation candle or on a break of its high.
*** Stop: below the OB low (or below nearby swing low for extra safety).
*** Take profit: target next structure level / liquidity pool / measured move. Aim for sensible R:R (≥1.5–2:1).
*** Mirror these for bearish trades (entry on bearish confirmation, stop above OB high).
** Invalidation & what to do when OBs fail
*** If a marked OB is overlapped / closed through by price (a full candle close beyond the OB) → immediately reassess:
*** Do not add to the trade; consider bias neutral until a new clean OB + displacement forms.
*** If multiple OBs fail on the same side, flip bias or wait for HTF confirmation.
** Quick practical checklist (use this every trade)
*** HTF trend: Bull / Bear / Neutral?
*** Structure: Higher highs / Lower lows?
*** Candle-color dominance in the swing (majority up/down closes)?
*** Mark opposite-color OB(s) + FVGs.
*** Is price retracing into OB during a killzone or session of interest? (optional)
*** Look for confirmation candle inside/after OB.
*** Entry, stop, TP set.
*** If OB is violated by full close → stop/stand aside.
*** Example (concrete)
*** HTF 4H shows higher highs → HTF bullish.
*** On 1H swing from 1.0900 → 1.1050: 9 of 12 candles closed bullish → bullish dominance.
*** Identify the last down-close candle before the big push 1.0980–1.0990 → mark that as bullish OB (range 1.0985–1.0975).
*** Price retraces to 1.0980 (inside OB) and produces a long lower wick candle that closes bullish → enter long on close above that wick’s high; stop = 1.0970 (below OB).
*** If price had closed decisively below 1.0975 (OB low) → invalidate bullish bias and stand aside.
*** Do’s & Don’ts (fast)
*** Do require a full candle close to confirm OB invalidation — don’t react to wicks only.
*** Do use HTF alignment — LTF signals are stronger when HTF agrees.
*** Don’t assume a single opposite candle is always enough — context matters (swing length, nearby liquidity).
*** Don’t trade broken setups; waiting for a clean OB + confirmation reduces drawdowns.
* Trading FVG
** Bearish FVG Setup
*** Imagine you have 3 candles in a bearish move:
*** Candle 1 → large down close.
*** Candle 2 → continuation down.
*** Candle 3 → follows through.
*** The FVG is between:
**** High of Candle 3 and
**** Low of Candle 1.
**** Entry (short) → when price retraces back into the FVG.
**** Stop loss placement (ICT rule):
**** Conservatively → above the open of Candle 2.
**** More aggressive → above the open of Candle 1.
**** Reason: If price trades above those levels, the imbalance is “invalidated” (market may not be bearish anymore).
** Bullish FVG Setup
*** In a bullish move:
*** Candle 1 → large up close.
*** Candle 2 → continuation up.
*** Candle 3 → follows through.
*** The FVG is between:
**** Low of Candle 3 and
**** High of Candle 1.
**** Entry (long) → ICT often teaches to place entry at the close of Candle 1 (the origin of the move); buy on discount and sell on premium.
**** Stop loss placement → below the low of Candle 2 (sometimes Candle 1 depending on risk tolerance).
**** Reason: If the market is truly bullish, price should respect the origin of the move (Candle 1 close) and not break significantly below it.
*** Intuition (why this works)
**** FVGs are footprints of institutional buying/selling.
**** When price comes back to “rebalance,” you are basically entering with the institutions.
**** Stops are placed just beyond the point where the imbalance would no longer make sense.
** Rule of thumb from ICT:
*** Bearish → sell from FVG retrace, stop above the Candle 2 open (sell on premium)
*** Bullish → buy from FVG retrace, entry at Candle 1 close, stop below Candle 2 low (buy on discount)
* Inversion FVG
*** Price Violates the FVG: Price moves through the Fair Value Gap with strong momentum instead of respecting it.
*** Role Reversal: The original FVG is no longer an area of expected support or resistance for a retracement; it becomes a new support or resistance level for the new, opposite directional move.
** Reclaimed (inverse) FVG
*** Original FVG Creation: A strong move (e.g., a rapid increase in a bullish trend) creates a Bullish FVG (expected to act as support when price returns).
*** Mitigation and Breakthrough (Reclaiming): Price returns to the Bullish FVG but, instead of finding support and reversing to continue the rally, it breaks down decisively through the entire gap and continues to move lower, suggesting a shift to a bearish market structure.
*** The Reclaimed Test: The market then retraces back up to the same zone (the previous Bullish FVG) which it has now successfully broken. The zone, which was expected to be support, is now "reclaimed" by the opposite side and is expected to act as a new resistance level.
* Build Bias: ICT London Session Judas Swing Model (Bearish Bias)
** Define the Previous Day’s Range
*** Draw a rectangle covering the high and low of the previous day.
**** Example:
**** High = 100
**** Low = 20
**** Range = 80 points/pips
** Mark the Opening Price (Anchor Point)
*** At 2:00 AM New York time (London open), mark the opening price.
*** That first 1-minute candle open is a key reference.
** Establish Context
*** If today’s opening price is below the previous day’s low (20 in the example) → bias is bearish.
*** This signals potential continuation lower, but ICT teaches: London usually runs liquidity first.
** Identify Liquidity Targets in Yesterday’s Range
*** Look inside yesterday’s range (20–100).
*** Find:
**** Equal highs
**** Or a single obvious high, especially if it’s in the lower 1/3 or 1/4 of the range.
**** These are pools of buy stops that institutions may target.
**  Anticipate the Judas Swing (False Move)
*** Around London open, expect price to:
*** Run above those equal/single highs (grab liquidity).
*** Then quickly reverse back down into bearish order flow.
*** Do not react impulsively to this spike. Expect it, let it happen.
** Trade Application
*** Aggressive scalpers: may buy the run up into the liquidity (but must be nimble — exit fast).
*** Higher-probability ICT model:
**** Wait for the Judas swing to finish.
**** Look for confirmation to short once price rejects above those highs.
**** Entry comes on retrace (OB/FVG), stop above Judas swing high, targeting liquidity lower.
** The Key Principle
*** London creates false breakouts.
*** They’re not “real breakouts” but engineered liquidity grabs.
*** Your job: wait for the trap → trade the reversal in line with bias.
** Formula in plain words:
*** If the day opens below yesterday’s low and you are bearish, then inside yesterday’s range look for highs (equal or single) in the lower portion. Around 2:00 AM NY time, anticipate price will run up into those highs (the Judas swing) and then reverse down.
* Pullback and inducement
** Pullback (General Idea)
*** A pullback is a temporary move against the dominant trend:
*** In a bullish market, the pullback is a move downward (retracement before price continues up).
*** In a bearish market, the pullback is a move upward (retracement before price continues down).
*** So it’s not a reversal—it’s just the market taking “a breath” before continuing.
** Valid Pullback
*** Not every little wick or pause is a real pullback. To be considered valid, it must show that liquidity has been taken or structure has been confirmed.
*** Bullish Market: For a pullback to be valid, the low of the highest candle must be broken (swept).
*** Bearish Market: For a pullback to be valid, the high of the lowest candle must be broken (swept).
*** The “validation” comes from liquidity being taken (stop hunts at previous candle high/low) or a candle close beyond that level.
*** Important: You don’t need the immediate next candle to do this. The confirmation can come a few candles later, as long as the prior high/low is eventually taken.
** Inducement
*** Inducement means the market is “tricking” traders into entering early before the real move.
*** In bullish conditions: price may start to dip, forming what looks like a pullback, but hasn’t swept the required low of the highest candle yet. Traders jump in too early, thinking it’s already a pullback. The market then goes lower to induce liquidity, sweeping those premature buyers’ stops, validating the pullback, and then the real continuation begins.
*** So: Inducement = false start / liquidity trap.
*** Valid pullback = after liquidity sweep or structural break.
** In simple terms:
*** A pullback is just price going against the main trend.
*** A valid pullback must sweep liquidity (previous high/low of the swing candle) or close beyond it.
*** Inducement is when price fakes a pullback before sweeping the real liquidity and making a true one.
* Mastering Daily Candle Bias
** Core Idea
*** Price often seeks liquidity, which usually sits around previous highs and lows (stop losses, pending orders, trapped traders). The market tends to “draw” toward these levels.
*** You’re defining rules for bias (bullish/bearish) based on how the current daily candle interacts with the previous day’s high and low.
** Sell Bias – Sweep Previous High, Close Below It
*** Condition: Current daily candle trades above the previous daily high (liquidity grab), but closes below that high.
*** Meaning: Buyers who entered on breakout are trapped, and liquidity above the high has been collected.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily low (downward bias).
** Buy Bias – Close Above Previous High
*** Condition: Current daily candle closes above the previous daily high.
*** Meaning: Market shows strength and continuation after breaking resistance.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily high (bullish continuation).
** Sell Bias – Close Below Previous Low
*** Condition: Current daily candle closes below the previous daily low.
*** Meaning: Market shows weakness and continuation after breaking support.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily low (bearish continuation).
** Buy Bias – Sweep Previous Low, Close Above It
*** Condition: Current daily candle trades below the previous daily low (liquidity grab), but closes above that low.
*** Meaning: Sellers who entered on breakdown are trapped, and liquidity below the low has been collected.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily high (upward bias).
** Simplified Framework
*** Sweep but close back inside → Reversal bias
*** Break and close outside → Continuation bias
* ICT Wick Grading Points
** Close (Starting/Ending Point): This is the price level where the real body of the candlestick ends and the wick begins.
=> For an upper wick, it's the top of the body; for a lower wick, it's the bottom of the body. It marks the boundary of the price that was sustained by the majority of the session's action.
** Lower Quadrant (25% Mark): This is the level that represents 25% of the total wick range, measured starting from the Close toward the extreme High/Low.
=> It's the first quarter of the wick. A strong reversal (rejection) will often only retrace into this first quadrant before continuing its move away from the wick's extreme.
** Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) - Half Way Point (50% Mark): The Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) is the 50% midpoint of the entire wick.
=> In ICT, the C.E. of any significant price range (like a wick or a Fair Value Gap) is a highly significant institutional reference point. It is often where price is expected to react or reverse upon a future retest.
=> If price retests the wick and is strongly rejected at or before the C.E., it suggests the original move (that formed the wick) has strong directional conviction. A move beyond the C.E. is often viewed as a sign of weakness in the original directional bias.
** Upper Quadrant (75% Mark): This is the level that represents 75% of the total wick range, measured starting from the Close toward the extreme High/Low.
=> This is the final quarter of the wick before the extreme. If price retests the wick and reaches this level, it suggests that the rejection that created the wick was relatively weak, or that the market is attempting to completely "fill" the void left by the wick.
** High / Low (Extreme Point): This is the absolute peak or trough of the price movement during the candle's duration.
=> It represents the final point of liquidity or "stop-loss cluster" that was likely targeted by the market makers before the strong reversal (rejection) occurred. If price trades through this point, the initial wick is considered fully violated and its significance as a reference point is lost.
** Wick Context: Premium vs. Discount: This grading system is particularly relevant when the wick is analyzed within the context of the larger price range:
*** Premium Wick (Upper Wick): A long upper wick formed when the price is in a Premium Zone (typically the upper 50% of a swing move). The wick represents a push higher to grab Buy-Side Liquidity before a move lower. You grade the upper wick's range to find potential entry or stop-loss refinement points for a short trade.
** Discount Wick (Lower Wick): A long lower wick formed when the price is in a Discount Zone (typically the lower 50% of a swing move). The wick represents a push lower to grab Sell-Side Liquidity before a move higher. You grade the lower wick's range to find potential entry or stop-loss refinement points for a long trade.
*** In summary, the grading system provides a precise way to measure and anticipate price reaction to the liquidity void left behind by a significant wick, with the Consequent Encroachment (50%) being the most critical level to monitor for a reaction.
** The Role of HTF Wicks in LTF Trading
*** Higher Timeframe Wick: Context and Liquidity
**** A long wick on an HTF candle (e.g., Daily) signifies a decisive move by institutional traders, often referred to as a Liquidity Sweep or Stop Hunt.
**** The Wick's Extreme (High/Low): This is the area where the "Smart Money" likely swept stop-loss orders or pending entries before reversing the price. It marks a critical boundary that the market failed to sustain.
**** The Wick's Graded Levels (C.E., Quadrants): By grading the wick (finding the 25%, Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) at 50%, and 75% levels), you are marking institutional reference points that price is likely to react to upon a future retest.
*** Lower Timeframe Trading: Entry and Confirmation
**** When the price later returns to the area of this significant HTF wick, you drop down to your LTF (e.g., 1-Minute) to watch for an entry setup.
**** HTF Wick Component	LTF Interpretation and Use
**** HTF Wick (Entire Area)	Becomes your Target Zone or Entry Zone.
**** Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) of the Wick	This is your High-Probability Entry Level. You wait for the price to trade to or near the C.E. on the LTF.
**** Price Action at the C.E.	You look for a Change in the LTF Market Structure (e.g., a break of a local low/high, formation of a Fair Value Gap, or an Order Block) to confirm the HTF directional bias is now active on the LTF.
****** Example Scenario (Bullish Reversal)
******   HTF (Daily): A Discount Wick (long lower wick) forms on the Daily chart, suggesting price was rejected from a cheap/discounted price level after sweeping sell-side liquidity.
****** LTF (1-Minute): The market starts moving back up, but then begins a small retracement. You mark the C.E. (50% point) of the Daily wick.
****** The Trade: When the price on the 1-Minute chart trades back down into the area around the Daily wick's C.E., you look for a tiny Market Structure Shift (e.g., a break of the most recent high on the 1-Minute chart) to confirm institutional buying is resuming. You enter the long trade with a tight stop-loss below the C.E. or the wick's low.
****** In short, the Daily wick gives you the conviction and the key levels, while the 1-Minute chart gives you the precision entry and risk management.
* London and New York Continuation and Reversals
** New York Continuation (Most Common)
*** This is the most frequent scenario where the New York Open confirms and continues the direction established by London.
*** London's Action (Your understanding): Price goes up to sweep liquidity/stop losses (the "Judas Swing") above the Asian session high, then distributes down for the main move.
*** New York's Action (Continuation): Price will often retrace back up during the New York Open (specifically the New York Kill Zone, roughly 7:00 AM – 9:00 AM ET) to a key institutional level like a Fair Value Gap (FVG), an Order Block, or the Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) of the London move.
*** The Move: Once the retracement hits this point (the manipulation of the New York session), it then continues the distribution from the London session and drops lower to target the day's main objective (e.g., sell-side liquidity).
*** Pattern: Up (Retracement/Manipulation) → Down (Continuation).
** New York Reversal (Less Common)
*** This happens when the New York Open reverses the main directional move of the London session. This often occurs when the London move itself was the manipulation.
*** London's Action: Price goes up to sweep liquidity (manipulation) then begins to distribute down, but this downward move fails to achieve a major objective and runs into a Higher Timeframe (HTF) level (like a Daily/Weekly Order Block or FVG) right before New York opens.
*** New York's Action (Reversal): The New York Open will often make a final push down to clear liquidity below the London Low or run into that HTF level (the manipulation of the New York session).
*** The Move: After clearing that final low, price immediately reverses and rallies strongly up, effectively reversing the entire London move and closing the high-to-low range of the day.
*** Pattern: Down (Final Liquidity Sweep/Manipulation) → Up (Reversal).
*** In summary, the New York Open always involves a manipulative move (a liquidity grab or a deep retracement into an imbalance) before the final, larger distribution move for the session. The HTF bias and the overall Daily Profile are what determine whether that final move is a continuation or a reversal.

* "Mohawk"
** In the context of ICT trading (Inner Circle Trader), a "Mohawk" generally refers to a specific type of price action that is considered a slight deviation or an allowance for a small false move outside of a key anticipated price level or area.
** Here's a breakdown based on the common usage within the ICT community:
*** A Small Deviation: It's used to describe a price movement that momentarily pushes just outside the boundary of an area a trader is watching (like an order block or a volume imbalance), but then quickly reverses.
*** Candlestick Appearance: On a lower timeframe chart (e.g., a one-minute chart), this move might look like a few small candle bodies pushing out. However, when viewed on a slightly higher timeframe (e.g., a five-minute chart), this price action often consolidates into just a long wick or "shadow" on a single candle, with the body closing back within the anticipated range.
*** Liquidity Grab: It often represents a very quick liquidity grab or a "stop hunt" by large institutional players (the "smart money") that runs slightly past a previous high or low to trigger stop-loss orders before the price reverses and continues in the expected direction.
*** Trader Expectation: The concept suggests that a skilled ICT trader should anticipate and allow for this slight "Mohawk" move without being stopped out or losing confidence in their trade idea, understanding that a perfect reversal right at the line is rare.
*** In essence, the term "Mohawk" helps describe a type of brief, manipulative excursion of price that is common in the market, often resulting in a noticeable wick on a higher-timeframe chart, and it's something ICT traders factor into their entry and stop-loss placement.
* Previous Day High and Low
** Liquidity Pools (The "Draw on Liquidity")
*** In the ICT framework, price is drawn to areas where large amounts of buy and sell orders are clustered. The PDH and PDL are prime examples of this:
*** PDH (Buy-Side Liquidity): A large number of buy-stop orders (from short sellers wanting to limit their loss) and buy-limit orders (from breakout traders) are placed just above the previous day's high. Price is often drawn to this level to "sweep" or "run" that liquidity.
*** PDL (Sell-Side Liquidity): A large number of sell-stop orders (from long buyers wanting to limit their loss) and sell-limit orders (from breakout traders) are placed just below the previous day's low. Price is often drawn to this level to "sweep" or "run" that liquidity.
*** The institutional traders ("Smart Money") need this clustered liquidity to fill their massive orders without moving the price against themselves. Therefore, price movements during the day are often framed around reaching and clearing one of these two external liquidity targets.
** Determining Intraday Bias
*** The market's reaction to the PDH and PDL provides a strong indication of the current day's directional bias:
*** Bullish Bias: If price sweeps the PDL and then quickly reverses and closes back inside the previous day's range, it suggests the sell-side liquidity was taken to fuel a move higher. The low has been put in.
*** been put in.
*** Continuation Bias: If price breaks and holds convincingly above the PDH or below the PDL, it signals a strong trending day is likely underway, and the previously broken level will often act as the first area of support/resistance on a pullback.
** High/Low of the Day Formation
*** According to ICT principles, the high or low of the day is often formed immediately after one of the major liquidity pools (like the PDH or PDL) is run, particularly during key Kill Zones (like the London Open or New York Open).
*** The Hunt: Institutions will push price to the PDH or PDL (a "liquidity hunt").
*** The Reversal: Once the stops are cleared, they often execute their true directional trade, causing a sharp reversal. This reversal point, which is just beyond the previous day's extreme, then becomes the high or low of the current trading day.
*** By marking the PDH and PDL, an ICT trader is essentially identifying the two most likely targets for institutional manipulation and the most probable candidates for the eventual high or low of the day.
* ICT Change in the State of Delivery (CISD)
** Bullish Candle Sweeps Liquidity (The Trap)
*** Event: "In bullish order block, if the last of the three candles sweep on liquidity..."
*** Last Candle: This is the last up-close (bullish/green) candle in the series, which is the potential Bearish Order Block candidate.
*** Sweep Liquidity: This candle pushes price above a previous high, a process often referred to as a Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL) Sweep or "Stop Hunt."
*** Institutional Action: Smart Money/institutions push the price just high enough to trigger the stop-loss orders of existing short traders and the buy-stop orders of breakout traders.
*** This executed liquidity provides the smart money with the necessary large volume of contracts to take their new short (sell) positions. This move completes the buying phase of their plan.
** The Change in the State of Delivery (The Confirmation)
*** Event: "...and the next candle moves below the open of the previous high candle, the market starts delivering sell side price."
*** The Next Candle: This is a down-close (bearish/red) candle that immediately follows the liquidity-sweeping candle.
*** Moves Below the Open: This bearish candle trades (and ideally closes) below the open of the previous bullish candle (the one that swept liquidity).
*** This specific price action—a move below the open of the last up-close candle—is the Change in the State of Delivery (CISD).
*** The last bullish candle was the "support" for the current buying campaign. By moving below its open, the market has symbolically invalidated that support.
*** It signifies that the aggressive selling from institutions (who just absorbed the liquidity from the sweep) is now overpowering the prior buying pressure.
** The Result: Sell-Side Price Delivery
*** Once the CISD is confirmed, the market is now in a sell-side delivery state.
*** The Bearish Order Block (B-OB): The last up-close candle that swept liquidity is now validated as a Bearish Order Block. This candle represents the point where significant institutional selling was injected into the market.
*** New Delivery State: The market's internal bias has flipped. Price is expected to continue moving lower as the algorithm is now programmed to deliver price more efficiently to the Sell-Side of the curve (i.e., lower prices) until it reaches the next major liquidity target or imbalance (like a Fair Value Gap or an opposing Order Block).
*** Trading Implication: Traders using this concept would now look to sell (go short) when the price retraces back up to test the high-probability Bearish Order Block or the imbalance left by the initial move down.
** Enter on FVG that overlaps with the low of order block on sell delivery and on the high of previous order block on buy side delivery.
* Mean Threshold
** The Concept of the Mean Threshold
*** The Mean Threshold is the 50% level of the Order Block candle's body (measuring from the Open to the Close, or High to Low, excluding the wicks in most high-probability definitions).
*** In the context of a Bearish Order Block (the last up-close candle before a large move down):
*** The entire candle represents a large volume of institutional selling being executed.
*** The Mean Threshold is the 50% mark of that concentrated activity.
** The Rule: Defense of the Mean Threshold
*** The rule states: For a Bearish Order Block to remain valid, price must not close above the Mean Threshold (50%) on the retracement/pullback.
*** Above 50% is considered the Premium half of the Order Block.
*** Below 50% is considered the Discount half.
** The Institutional Logic
*** The Mean Threshold is viewed as a line of "defense" for the institutions who initiated the move.
*** Maximum Concession: The Mean Threshold represents the maximum price concession that institutions are willing to allow the market to return to before continuing their sell program.
*** Unfilled Orders: Institutions are assumed to have a significant volume of unfilled sell orders remaining at or near the Order Block area. They are expected to let the price retrace into this zone to "mitigate" (fill) those remaining orders at an advantageous price (i.e., the highest price possible, which is why a retracement is needed).
*** Invalidation of Intent: If price not only trades above the Mean Threshold but actually closes above it, it signals that the original selling pressure was too weak to hold the center of its own price zone. It implies that a new wave of buyers (or a lack of sellers) has successfully pushed the price deep into the area of initial selling, negating the expected strong resistance.
** What Happens if it Closes Above the Mean Threshold?
*** If the price closes above the Mean Threshold of a Bearish Order Block, the Order Block is generally considered failed or invalidated for a high-probability trade setup.
*** The market is likely to continue pushing higher, potentially to the high of the Order Block candle or even above it, indicating that the Change in the State of Delivery (CISD) that formed the Order Block may have been a false signal, and the original bullish trend is resuming.
*** In short, the Mean Threshold is the critical filter that distinguishes a high-probability entry point from a potential trap. A close above it tells the ICT trader to abandon the short trade setup.
* Consequent Encroachment (CE)
** What is a Fair Value Gap (FVG)?
*** First, you must understand the FVG. An FVG (also known as an Imbalance or an Inefficiency) is a three-candle price pattern where the high of the first candle and the low of the third candle do not overlap.
*** This creates a "gap" or a void in price action, indicating that the market moved too quickly in one direction, leaving behind a zone where no counter-side orders were executed.
*** The market is highly likely to return to this zone to "fill" or "mitigate" the imbalance, as the price delivery algorithm seeks to re-establish a fair price.
** The Definition of Consequent Encroachment (CE)
*** The Consequent Encroachment (CE) is the exact midpoint (50%) of the range of the FVG.
*** You measure from the top of the FVG to the bottom of the FVG, and the 50% line is the CE.
** The Institutional Logic: Why CE is Important
*** Just like the Mean Threshold for an Order Block, the CE for an FVG serves as a critical filter and a high-probability entry or mitigation level.
*** Magnet and Mitigation Point: When price returns to the FVG, it is often attracted to the CE. This midpoint acts as the true value level where institutional orders are most likely to be filled. The institutions that created the original impulsive move will often have limit orders sitting at or near the CE to complete their large position at a better price.
*** Validation Filter: Price's reaction to the CE determines the strength of the original move:
*** In a Bullish FVG: If price retraces into the gap, it should ideally find support and reverse before closing below the CE. A close below the CE suggests the original buying pressure is weak, and the FVG is more likely to be completely filled or even broken through.
*** In a Bearish FVG: If price retraces into the gap, it should find resistance and reverse before closing above the CE. A close above the CE suggests the original selling pressure is weak, and the FVG is more likely to be completely filled or broken.
** CE as a Refined Entry or Target
*** Traders use the CE to create a higher-probability setup:
=> Zone	Action	Rule
=> Bullish FVG	Entry for Long	Wait for price to enter the FVG and touch or trade just below the CE before entering. This gives you a better entry price (a "discount" entry within the imbalance) 
=> Bearish FVG	Entry for Short	Wait for price to enter the FVG and touch or trade just above the CE before entering. This gives you a better entry price (a "premium" entry within the imbalance).
=> Target	Take Profit	The CE of a large FVG or other PD Array on a higher timeframe can be used as a high-probability take-profit target, as price often seeks out these midpoints.
*** Summary of the 50% Rule
=> Concept	Zone	50% Level Name	Rule (Bearish Context)
=> Order Block (OB)	The last up-close candle	Mean Threshold (MT)	Price must not close above the Mean Threshold on the retracement.
=> Fair Value Gap (FVG)	The price imbalance zone	Consequent Encroachment (CE)	Price must not close above the Consequent Encroachment on the retracement.
* Equilibrium
** Equilibrium as the 50% Midpoint
*** In price action trading, Equilibrium is mathematically defined as the 50% level of a price swing or range.
*** Identify a Range: This range is typically the distance between a recent Swing High and a recent Swing Low (or vice versa) on the chart.
*** Calculate the Midpoint: The 50% mark of that distance is the Equilibrium line.
*** The Fair Value Zone: When price is at this 50% level, it is considered to be at Fair Market Value.
** Discount and Premium Zones
*** The concept of Equilibrium is crucial because it divides the price range into two critical zones that guide trading decisions:
=> Price Zone	Location	Trading Bias	Institutional Logic
=> Premium	Above the 50% Equilibrium	Optimal to Sell (Short)	The price is considered "expensive" or overvalued for a long position. Institutions look to sell or take profit here.
=> Discount	Below the 50% Equilibrium	Optimal to Buy (Long)	The price is considered "cheap" or undervalued for a short position. Institutions look to buy or enter long positions here.
*** The Core Trading Rule
*** The main principle is: Never Buy in a Premium, and Never Sell in a Discount.
*** Institutional traders aim to buy assets when they are cheap (in the Discount zone) and sell assets when they are expensive (in the Premium zone) relative to the recent price action. Price will often move impulsively away from the Equilibrium and then retrace back toward it to seek liquidity for a better entry.
** Equilibrium in ICT Concepts
*** Equilibrium is applied to specific institutional price structures:
*** Optimal Trade Entry (OTE): The OTE (usually the 62%, 70.5%, or 79% Fibonacci levels) exists in the Discount (for buys) or Premium (for sells) zone, just beyond the Equilibrium. Traders wait for price to penetrate the 50% level and enter the deeper OTE zone for the highest probability entries.
*** Mean Threshold (MT) / Consequent Encroachment (CE): These are essentially the Equilibrium (50%) of an Order Block or a Fair Value Gap (FVG), respectively. They are used as precise confirmation levels to gauge the strength of the institutional block or gap. If price closes past the 50% mark of these zones, it often invalidates the expected reaction.
* Regular Trading Hour (RTH) and Electronic Trading Hour (ETH)
** This is the primary US session. You will see high volume, tighter spreads, and the most significant price moves, especially when major economic news is released.
** ETH (Extended/Electronic Trading Hours) is the overnight, Asian, and European sessions. You will generally see lower volume, wider spreads, and choppy or quiet price action. Volatility can spike briefly, especially after major Asian or European news.
*** The price movement during the period outside of RTH—specifically from 4:00 PM (16:00) ET to 9:30 AM ET the next day—is what creates the potential RTH gap.
*** RTH open at 9:30 ET with opening price of the high-volume cash market. 
*** RTH Close at 4:00 PM ET; The closing price of the high-volume cash market session.
*** ETH/Overnight Session from 4:00 PM ET to 9:30 AM ET; The low-volume trading that occurs while the cash market is closed. Price discovery here is "less liquid."
** The gap is the difference between the RTH Close (4:00 PM) and the RTH Open (9:30 AM)
** The Role of RTH Price Action
*** Re-testing/Filling ETH Gaps: The ETH gap represents a low-volume, potentially inefficient move. When the high-volume RTH opens, the market may see the gap area as a zone of imbalance (or Fair Value Gap/FVG) that needs to be traded through or "filled" to achieve greater efficiency before continuing the original move. This is a key trading principle for many strategies.
*** Addressing Liquidity Pools: Liquidity pools (often located just above significant swing highs/double tops or below significant swing lows/double bottoms) represent concentrated resting orders (stop-losses or pending orders). RTH price action is frequently driven by large institutions looking to "sweep" or "run" these liquidity pools to fuel their own large entries or exits.
*** Reacting to News of the Day: Economic data releases (e.g., CPI, FOMC minutes, NFP), earnings reports, and geopolitical events are typically released either before the RTH open or during the RTH session. These announcements are the primary fundamental catalysts that provide the necessary energy and institutional conviction to drive price through established support/resistance levels and, importantly, confirm or reject the direction of the overnight ETH move.
*** Imbalances and Fair Value Gaps (FVG): Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and other imbalances are specific footprints of institutional participation. During RTH, the high volume provides the market structure to either immediately close an FVG (an efficient move) or to create a new, larger FVG (a strong directional conviction). The RTH is the most reliable time to trade these institutional concepts.
*** In essence, the ETH gap sets the stage, while liquidity, fundamental news, and institutional imbalances (FVG) provide the engine and the targets for the ensuing price action during the RTH.
* ICT One Trade Setup for Life (Liquidity-Based Outline)
** Core Principle: Draw on Liquidity
*** Main driving force of the market: Liquidity.
*** Two types of liquidity pools:
**** Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL): Stops resting below old lows, support zones, and session range lows.
**** Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL): Stops resting above old highs, resistance zones, and session range highs.
*** Price is constantly seeking these pools, sweeping one side to fuel moves to the opposite side.
** Daily PM Session Range (1:30–4:00 PM NY Local Time)
*** Define the range: Highest high and lowest low between 1:30–4:00 PM.
*** Bullish day logic:
**** First, target Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL) → sweep the lows.
**** Then, expand higher toward Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL) → target the highs.
*** PM range acts as a roadmap for the following trading sessions.
** London Session Raid (2:00–5:00 AM Local Time)
*** Identify London session high/low (liquidity zones).
*** At NY Open (9:30 AM):
**** If NY open is above London’s BSL, then target London SSL (downside raid).
**** If NY open is below London’s SSL, then target London BSL (upside raid).
*** This creates the AM directional bias into RTH.
** Regular Trading Hours (RTH) (4:14–9:30 AM NY Local Time)
*** RTH logic revolves around the closing gap (prior day’s close vs. RTH open).
**** If price opens below closing gap and sweeps Sell-Side Liquidity,
**** In the afternoon, expect price to rally into Buy-Side Liquidity.
**** If price opens above closing gap and sweeps Buy-Side Liquidity,
**** In the afternoon, expect price to fall into Sell-Side Liquidity.
** New York Lunch Raid (12:00–1:30 PM)
*** Lunch session is a liquidity trap zone.
*** Logic:
**** If price is below SSL, target BSL.
**** If price is above BSL, target SSL.
**** Bearish day filter:
**** Wait for a run up into the Opening Gap.
**** Hunt Lunch Buy-Side Liquidity, then shift bias toward Sell-Side Liquidity below.
** AM Session Ranges (9:30 AM–12:00 Noon NY Local Time)
*** AM session targets the previous high or low of AM or PM ranges.
*** RTH levels are respected — next day’s price action often raids the prior day’s AM/PM session liquidity.
*** If AM is choppy or directionless, do not force trades.
*** Instead, wait for PM session at 1:30 PM for clearer setups.
** Trade Filtering Logic (One Trade a Day)
*** London Bias: Define raid direction (BSL or SSL).
*** NY AM Session: Confirm by sweep + structure shift.
*** RTH / Lunch / PM Range: Execute on the cleanest liquidity raid that aligns with the higher bias.
*** Risk Management: Stop beyond raid extreme; target opposite liquidity pool.
*** Only one trade needed per day if following liquidity path from session to session.
* Suspension Block
** “Isolated candlestick” → This means the candle is standing apart contextually (it’s not part of a cluster, and it has a distinct role).
** If there’s an FVG on both sides of the candle, that candle becomes “suspended” between two gaps.
** Algorithm letter comes to it → That’s your way of saying the algorithm recognizes it as a reference point. Price might return to it because it is balanced between inefficiencies.
** A single candle positioned between an FVG above and an FVG below, acting as a reference point where price may gravitate back because it represents a balanced or suspended state in an otherwise imbalanced structure.
*** Think of it like this:
*** The market leaves inefficiencies both ways.
*** The isolated candle becomes the anchor between them.
*** When algorithms “read” this, they might treat that block as a temporary equilibrium level that price later revisits.
* Long Wicks
** Wicks represent unfilled or imbalanced trading.
*** A wick (upper or lower shadow of a candle) shows that price moved into that area but didn’t stay there.
*** The body of the candle closed away from that wick, which suggests there wasn’t enough buying/selling pressure to hold price there.
** Algorithms treat that as unfinished business (like a gap).
*** Just like a “fair value gap” (FVG) marks an imbalance in trading (where one side dominated), wicks also show imbalance.
*** So to the algorithm, a long wick = an area where price didn’t get properly traded/auctioned.
*** In other words, price “skipped over” that zone quickly, almost like a small gap in liquidity.
** Practical meaning for traders:
*** Algorithms (and traders who follow them) may expect price to revisit those wick areas to “rebalance” liquidity.
**** A long downside wick might later get filled as price trades back down.
**** A long upside wick might get revisited from above.
* The ICT Breaker Block is primarily known as a reversal pattern, but it can also be used in a continuation context, especially when viewed across multiple timeframes.
** Primarily a Reversal Pattern (Market Structure Shift)
*** The classic Breaker setup signals a change in the intermediate or short-term trend, which is why it is famous as a reversal pattern:
*** The Setup: A Breaker is created when a swing point (which was initially a valid Order Block) fails to hold price and is broken through, causing a Market Structure Shift (MSS).
** The Reversal: The price action confirms a reversal. For instance, in a bullish breaker, the market fails to make a new lower low after running liquidity, reverses, and breaks a previous swing high, indicating the sellers are now trapped and the trend has flipped to the upside.
*** Key Concept: The Breaker block zone (the failed Order Block) acts as the entry point for the new direction, which is a reversal of the recent swing.
** Can Act as a Continuation Tool (High-Timeframe Context)
*** While the Breaker itself causes a reversal of the immediate price swing, it often serves as a continuation or re-entry point in the context of the higher-timeframe trend or a larger overall bias.
*** Continuation Example: Imagine the Daily chart is clearly in a strong uptrend.
*** Price starts a healthy correction (a pullback on the 4H chart).
*** This pullback on the 4H chart creates a setup where a Bullish Breaker forms (e.g., a small stop run below an old low, followed by a Market Structure Shift back up).
*** When the 4H Breaker is traded, you are entering the market as a reversal of the recent 4-hour pullback, but a continuation of the long-term Daily uptrend.
*** In summary:
**** The Breaker is a Reversal of the immediate, local price swing that created it (e.g., reversing the move that swept the liquidity).
**** The Breaker is a Continuation if that reversal aligns with and continues the dominant trend observed on a higher timeframe.
* Key Components of the ICT Unicorn Model
** Breaker Block (BB): A former Order Block that failed to hold as support/resistance and was broken through, now expected to serve the opposite role. For example, a broken bullish order block becomes a bearish breaker block.
** Fair Value Gap (FVG): A three-candle pattern that shows a price imbalance where the first and third candles' wicks don't overlap. Price is often expected to return to this "gap" to fill the inefficiency.
** Unicorn Zone: The area of overlap where the Breaker Block and Fair Value Gap coincide. This confluence is what makes the setup a "Unicorn" (a rare, high-quality entry).
** The setup is usually sought after a shift in market structure, and the trading entry is typically placed when the price returns (retests) this "Unicorn Zone" of confluence.
* Reason for Market Movement
** Market moves to hunt liquidity
*** Concept: The market seeks areas where stop-loss orders are clustered. This usually means above swing highs or below swing lows, where retail traders often place stops.
*** Reason: Smart money (institutions, banks) need liquidity to execute large orders without leaving huge footprints. They “hunt” these areas to fill their positions efficiently.
** Market moves to rebalance inefficiencies
*** Concept: Inefficiencies are gaps, imbalances, or areas where price moved too quickly without proper order flow.
*** Reason: The market likes smooth order flow. These “inefficient” areas are often Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)—zones where institutions left unfilled orders.
** Market moves to rebalance equilibrium
*** Concept: Equilibrium refers to the market’s fair value or mean price in an area. Often, price oscillates around an equilibrium point in a consolidation.
*** Reason: After an imbalance or excessive deviation, the market seeks to bring price back to a fair value where buyers and sellers are in relative agreement.
*** Example: Price rallies too far above a consolidation range. The market often retraces toward the middle of the range (equilibrium) before making the next directional move.
*** Keywords: value area, mean reversion, consolidation midpoint.
** Market moves to create liquidity
*** Concept: The market sometimes creates opportunities to generate liquidity, often by moving price to areas where traders have positions.
*** Reason: Smart money wants to enter positions with enough liquidity available. Sometimes, it induces traders to take the wrong side first to “create” the liquidity needed.
*** Example: Price dips slightly below a support, enticing retail traders to short. These shorts provide the liquidity smart money needs to buy aggressively, causing price to reverse upward.
*** Keywords: inducement, liquidity creation, stop-hunting, smart money positioning.
** How these ideas connect
*** Hunt liquidity → create liquidity: These are the most aggressive moves by smart money to fill orders.
*** Rebalance inefficiencies → rebalance equilibrium: These are more corrective moves to ensure smooth market flow and fair pricing.
*** All together: Price is rarely random. Smart money orchestrates moves that hunt liquidity, create liquidity, and correct inefficiencies while keeping equilibrium as the “center of gravity.”

* Equilibrium
** Equilibrium as a Midway Point
*** Definition: The equilibrium is the midpoint of the price range defined by the most recent Swing Low and the most recent Swing High.
*** Significance: It serves as a dividing line for value.
*** In a bullish trend, the area above equilibrium (50%) is considered the Premium zone (expensive for buyers), and the area below equilibrium is the Discount zone (cheap for buyers).
*** Traders following this approach wait for the price to retrace (pull back) into the Discount zone (below the 50% Equilibrium level) during an uptrend to look for a buy entry. The market is considered "fair value" at the equilibrium line itself.
** Determining the Swing High and The Setup
*** The strategy uses a specific, four-candle pattern to confirm the formation of the Swing High that marks the end of the initial rally and the start of the pullback (retracement).
*** The setup for confirming a Swing High is:
**** Candle 1 (Left): A candle with a high price.
**** Candle 2 (Center/Highest): The candle with the absolute highest high price in the immediate sequence. This candle forms the Swing High peak.
**** Candle 3 (Right): A candle with a lower high than the center candle.
**** Candle 4 (Confirmation): A final candle that confirms the shift in momentum by showing price going lower (a lower close/body, or a definitive drop from the high).
**** Once this four-candle swing high is formed, it establishes the top of your price range (the "Swing High" point) for measuring the Equilibrium. This is a common method in technical analysis to objectively define a swing point, regardless of the time frame.
** The Trading Principle
*** After identifying the Swing Low and Swing High of the most recent price move, the strategy follows these steps:
*** Initial Rally: The price moves from a low point and rallies up, forming the Swing High using the four-candle confirmation pattern.
*** Wait for Retracement: The rally ends, and the price begins to retrace (pull back/come down).
*** Target Entry Zone: The trader waits for the price to drop back to or below the Equilibrium (50%) level into the Discount zone. This area is considered a favorable price to buy for a continuation of the bullish trend, as the price is "cheap" relative to the full move.
*** Buy: Once the price reaches the equilibrium or the Discount zone, the trader looks for a confirmation (like a bullish candlestick or other technical signal) to enter a long (buy) position, anticipating the trend will resume and push the price to new highs.
**   The same process holds for bearish setup
* ICT Propulsion Block
** The Core Structure (Order Block Interaction)
*** A Propulsion Block is characterized by its interaction with a prior Order Block (OB). It's a single candlestick that performs a quick retest of the Order Block and then drives the price with momentum in the opposite direction.
** Bullish Propulsion Block
*** A bullish PB is the last bearish (down-closed) candlestick in a strong uptrend that:
**** Trades into an existing Bullish Order Block.
**** Immediately triggers a strong upward price movement (displacement), confirming the Order Block's validity.
**** Trading use: When price later retraces back to this specific bullish candlestick, it is expected to act as a highly sensitive support zone, causing a sharp reversal to the upside.
** Bearish Propulsion Block
*** A bearish PB is the last bullish (up-closed) candlestick in a strong downtrend that:
**** Trades into an existing Bearish Order Block.
**** Immediately triggers a strong downward price movement (displacement), confirming the Order Block's validity.
**** Trading use: When price later retraces back to this specific bearish candlestick, it is expected to act as a highly sensitive resistance zone, causing a sharp reversal to the downside.
** Key Validation Criteria (Mean Threshold)
*** For a Propulsion Block to be considered valid, its Mean Threshold (MT) is a critical factor:
*** The Mean Threshold is the 50% retracement level of the Propulsion Block candlestick's body or range (from high to low/low to high).
*** During the retest of the Propulsion Block, the price should not close beyond the Mean Threshold of the Propulsion Block candle. If price breaks or closes past this 50% mark, the block's integrity is compromised, and it is no longer considered a high-probability trade setup.
*** By respecting the Mean Threshold, the Propulsion Block acts as a tighter, more precise entry point than the entire Order Block zone, allowing traders to execute trades with minimal drawdown and a small stop-loss, which results in a high reward-to-risk ratio.
* The Logic of the Reclaimed Order Block and Dealing Range
*** Reclaimed Order Block (OB) Definition: A Reclaimed OB is an Order Block that was initially violated or "broken" by price, appearing to be invalidated. However, price then returns to the zone, respects it, and continues in the original direction, reclaiming the zone as a valid Point of Interest (POI). This often suggests institutional traders have accumulated or distributed orders in that zone.
*** The Dealing Range: In the ICT methodology, the Dealing Range is the current, active Swing High and Swing Low. The market is expected to move from one side of the range (a discount/premium Price Delivery Array) to the other (liquidity at the opposite swing high/low).
** The High/Low Not Taken Condition (Liquidity):
*** If the price does not take out the high or low of the current dealing range before returning to the broken Order Block, it means the liquidity at that high or low is still intact.
*** This intact liquidity becomes the primary target for the move after the order block is reclaimed.
** Conclusion
*** A Reclaimed Order Block is often a more powerful setup when the Dealing Range high (in a bullish scenario) or low (in a bearish scenario) has not been taken.
*** This leaves a clean, uncleared liquidity pool (an external liquidity target) for the market to move toward, giving the trade a high-probability target and clear objective.
*** The market has completed the institutional accumulation phase (the reclaim) and is now poised to run to the next major area of liquidity (the dealing range high/low).
* The Logic of Inversion/Reclaimed Fair Value Gap (IFVG)
** The concept of a "reclaimed" FVG aligns with the Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG).
*** An IFVG occurs when price violates an existing FVG by trading and closing completely through it. This suggests a shift in market momentum.
*** The former FVG then "flips" its role: a violated bullish FVG becomes new resistance (bearish IFVG), and a violated bearish FVG becomes new support (bullish IFVG).
*** The relationship to the dealing range is often used to give context to this shift. For a true shift in market structure and a highly probable trade setup, the FVG inversion is often accompanied by or occurs shortly after a liquidity sweep (taking a swing high or low).
** So the logic of reclaimed fvg is different from reclaimed ob.
* Consolidation and Key Mid-Point Concepts 
** Equilibrium (EQ)
*** Definition: The 50% mark of any defined Dealing Range (the swing high to swing low of a major move or a consolidation range).
*** Role in Consolidation: Price often enters a period of consolidation, or a holding pattern, precisely around the Equilibrium of a larger range. This is the Fair Value of that range, where institutional participants accumulate or distribute orders before expanding the range toward the next liquidity objective (the high or low).
** Consequent Encroachment (CE)
*** Definition: The 50% mark of a Fair Value Gap (FVG).
*** Role in Consolidation/Reaction: While CE is most often used as a high-probability entry level for a re-tracement before price expands, price can also consolidate around it. If price returns to the FVG but lacks the momentum for a full mitigation, it may pause and consolidate around the CE—the fair value of that inefficiency—before the next move.
** Mean Threshold (MT)
*** Definition: The 50% mark of an Order Block (OB) or Breaker Block.
*** Role in Consolidation/Reaction: Similar to CE, the MT is the equilibrium of the Order Block. When price revisits an OB, institutions may not need to fill the entire block. Price frequently reacts, or pauses/consolidates, around the Mean Threshold as it's the fair price within that institutional footprint. Consolidation here can indicate that buy or sell limit orders are being absorbed
**** In short, any 50% mark of a major price array or range (Dealing Range, FVG, Order Block) is an Equilibrium point. Since consolidation is a market state where buyers and sellers are balanced, it frequently occurs at these mid-point levels as the market searches for fair value before deciding on the next direction.

*** The New Day Opening Gap High and Low are derived from the 4:59 p.m. (prior day's close) and 6:00 p.m. (new day's open) prices, and are specifically associated with the New Trading Day they precede.
* Entry Models
** ICT 2022
*** The ICT 2022 Model is a structured, high-probability price action entry strategy designed to capture market reversals or continuations after a liquidity grab. It is built on four core phases:
*** Liquidity Sweep: Price moves beyond a previous high (buy-side liquidity) or low (sell-side liquidity) to trigger stop-loss orders and trap retail traders, completing the "manipulation" phase.
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS): After the liquidity sweep, the price rapidly breaks a recent minor swing high (for a long setup) or swing low (for a short setup) in the opposite direction of the sweep, signaling a change in the immediate market bias.
*** Displacement + Entry: The shift in structure must occur with displacement, a strong, fast move that leaves behind an Imbalance or Fair Value Gap (FVG). The entry is taken on a subsequent retracement back into this FVG or an Order Block (OB).
*** Exit at Liquidity: The trade's target is a pre-determined liquidity pool, such as a major previous high/low or an area of old consolidation.
** MMXM (Market Maker Model)
*** The MMXM (Market Maker Buy Model or Market Maker Sell Model) is a concept that maps out the complete cyclical movement of price, driven by "Smart Money" (institutional traders). It describes how institutions accumulate positions, manipulate price to create liquidity, and then distribute or liquidate those positions.
*** The cycle typically involves:
**** Consolidation (Accumulation): Price moves sideways as institutions quietly build their positions.
**** Manipulation (Smart Money Reversal - SMR): A sharp move in the opposite direction of the intended trend, often sweeping key highs/lows (ERL) to trigger stops and create liquidity.
**** Distribution: The market moves strongly in the direction of the institutional position, driving price to a higher-timeframe target.
**** A trade entry often seeks to capitalize on the start of the Distribution phase, following the Manipulation/SMR.
*** IFVG (Inverse Fair Value Gap)
**** An IFVG is an Inverse Fair Value Gap (sometimes called an Inversion FVG). It is a standard Fair Value Gap (FVG) that has been traded through and failed to act as support or resistance, but subsequently reverses its role and becomes a point of support (if broken to the upside) or resistance (if broken to the downside) for a trend continuation.
**** Setup: A price gap forms (the FVG). Price then trades through the FVG, effectively "invalidating" its original intent.
**** Entry: When price retraces back to the now-inverted FVG, the IFVG acts as a strong support or resistance zone in line with the new, established trend. Traders use the retest of the IFVG as a high-probability entry point.
** PO3 (Power of 3)
*** The PO3 (Power of 3) is a daily price action framework that breaks the trading day's activity into three essential parts, similar to the MMXM, but often applied to a single daily candle's formation:
*** Accumulation: The market opens and consolidates around the opening price, with institutions building their positions (often during low-volume sessions like Asia).
*** Manipulation: Price moves to take liquidity (sweep highs/lows) before the real move, often during a high-volatility session (like London or New York open), trapping traders on the wrong side.
*** Distribution: Price expands strongly in the intended direction for the day, driven by the institutional flow.
*** An entry model based on PO3 typically waits for the Manipulation phase to complete and enters as the Distribution phase begins, trading in the direction of the distribution toward the Daily Range objectives.
** CRT (Candlestick Range Theory)
*** CRT (Candlestick Range Theory) is a concept that views a single higher-timeframe candlestick as containing the full Power of 3 (PO3) sequence on a lower timeframe.
*** Concept: The range (high-to-low) of a high-timeframe candle (e.g., a 4-hour candle) represents the market's activity for that period.
*** Application: By zooming into a lower timeframe (e.g., a 15-minute chart), a trader can observe the price action within the higher-timeframe candle's range. The lower-timeframe movement will often show:
**** Accumulation (at the open/close level).
**** Manipulation (the high/low wick that sweeps liquidity).
**** Distribution (the main body move).
**** Entry: The CRT model encourages traders to enter near the low/high of the manipulation wick on the lower timeframe, anticipating the higher-timeframe candle will close strongly in the opposite direction (the distribution).
** IRL (Internal Range Liquidity)
*** Definition: Liquidity that resides within the current established dealing range (between the most recent swing high and swing low).
*** Examples: Fair Value Gaps (FVG), Order Blocks, and minor, internal swing highs/lows.
*** Function: Price typically targets IRL for rebalancing (filling gaps) or retesting institutional levels before moving to the ERL.
** ERL (External Range Liquidity)
*** Definition: Liquidity that resides outside the current established dealing range, typically at the most significant swing high or swing low of the range.
*** Examples: Major swing highs (Buy-Side Liquidity) and major swing lows (Sell-Side Liquidity).
*** Function: ERL is the ultimate target for a major price move. It represents where the stops of large groups of traders are clustered, making it the "Draw on Liquidity."
* Major vs Minor Buyside/Sellside Liquidity Pools
** Major liquidity pool
*** Major Liquidity is found at highly significant, well-established highs or lows that are visible across higher timeframes (HTFs). Sweeping a Major Liquidity zone often precedes a large, sustained move in the opposite direction.
*** It represents the largest pools of stop-losses.It's Timeframe is Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Quarterly charts.
*** It is located at Previous Day's High/Low (PDH/PDL), Previous Week's High/Low (PWH/PWL), Equal Highs/Lows (EQH/EQL) on a daily chart.
** Minor Liquidity
*** Minor Liquidity is found at the highs or lows of smaller, short-term swings, typically on lower timeframes (LTFs). Sweeping Minor Liquidity often occurs within a larger move and can serve as inducement or a point for a short-term correction before continuing toward a Major Liquidity target.
*** It has low significance and represents smaller, short-term pools of stop-losses.
*** Its timeframe is 5-minute (M5), 15-minute (M15), or 1-hour (H1) charts.
*** It is located at session of Highs/Lows (e.g., Asia, London, or New York Session swings) or internal swing points within a large daily candle.
** The Relationship in Trading
*** ICT traders use this hierarchy to determine the most likely price targets:
**** Price is always drawn toward the nearest significant liquidity pool.
**** Institutions may first sweep Minor Liquidity (a short-term "stop hunt" or Inducement) to gather contracts, and then continue the overall move toward the Major Liquidity target.
**** A price reversal after sweeping a Major Liquidity level is considered a much higher-probability trade setup.
* Trade in Each 60 Minute Interval
** Targeting Liquidity Pools (The "Spool" and Run)
*** This is a move specifically aimed at gathering resting orders (liquidity) before the market moves into the intended direction.
**** To a Short-Term Low (Sell-Side Liquidity): The price sharply drops to a recent short-term low. Just below these lows, a large concentration of sell stop orders (from traders in long positions) and buy limit orders (from traders looking to enter long positions) is typically clustered.
**** Action: The smart money drives the price down to "sweep" or "tap into" this Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL). This fills their large buy orders by triggering the stop-losses of sellers and matching the pending buy limits.
**** Result: With their buy orders filled, the market has the fuel to then reverse and move higher, often leading to a Liquidity Run in the opposite direction.
**** To a Short-Term High (Buy-Side Liquidity): The price sharply rises to a recent short-term high. Just above these highs, a large concentration of buy stop orders (from traders in short positions) and sell limit orders (from traders looking to enter short positions) is typically clustered.
**** Action: The smart money drives the price up to "sweep" or "tap into" this Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL). This fills their large sell orders by triggering the stop-losses of buyers and matching the pending sell limits.
**** Result: With their sell orders filled, the market has the fuel to then reverse and move lower.
** Trading to Inefficiency (The Setup Before the Spool)
*** This objective describes a preparatory move that serves as a high-probability entry point for traders who are aware of the institutional logic.
**** Inefficiency (often called a Fair Value Gap or FVG in ICT concepts) refers to an area on the chart where price moved very fast in one direction, leaving a gap where only one side of the market (buy or sell) was active. This is considered an imbalance that the market needs to re-balance.
**** Action: Before the market "spools" (makes its big run) to the external liquidity (the short-term high or low), it may first trade back to an internal inefficiency or Fair Value Gap.
**** Result: This movement back into the FVG is an invitation for smart money (and the retail traders who follow their concepts) to enter their positions at a better price. Once their orders are filled at this more favorable imbalance, the market then has the impetus to make the final "spool" move towards the primary liquidity target (the short-term high or low) to complete its objective.
* Macros (When there is no economic calendar event)
** What the ICT Macro Represents
*** In ICT terminology, the "Macro" is essentially a scheduled time slot where traders following this methodology expect increased market activity and potential trade setups due to the release of economic news, institutional order flow, or systematic market manipulation.
*** The Window: The Macro exists 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after every single hour (e.g., 8:50 to 9:10, 9:50 to 10:10, etc.). This makes it a 20-minute period.
*** Significance: ICT followers believe that institutions or "smart money" often execute significant order flow, manipulate price, or trigger pre-planned moves during these specific times, making them important times to be attentive to the charts.
*** The "Something Important": This "something important" is typically a setup or a move that aligns with the current market direction, such as:
**** Liquidity grabs: Price moving quickly to "sweep" or clear out stop-loss orders above or below a recent high or low.
**** Fair Value Gap (FVG) or Inversion FVG entries: Price re-visiting an inefficiency in the chart to continue a trend.
**** Reversal points: Price hitting a key level (like a high or low of the day) and reversing course.
** Contextualizing the Macro
*** While the Macro exists every hour, its relevance is generally heightened during specific, high-impact trading sessions or when coinciding with the release of major economic data.
*** Key Sessions: The Macro is most closely watched during the London Open, the New York Open, and sometimes the London Close or New York Close, as these are periods of high liquidity and institutional participation.
*** Not a Guarantee: It's important to understand that the ICT Macro is a time-based hypothesis or a model, not a guaranteed trading signal. It merely suggests a higher probability window for a significant price move to occur, prompting traders to look for their specific ICT setup (like an OTE, FVG, etc.) during that time.
* Scalping 
** Definition: Scalping is a trading strategy that aims to profit from very small price changes (or "pips") in a financial asset.
** The Timeframe is Key
*** The most defining characteristic of scalping is the extremely short duration of the trade.
*** In and Out Quickly: A scalper is typically in a trade for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.
*** Maximum Hold Time: The 30-minute limit is a very conservative maximum for what a dedicated scalper would consider, as it approaches the timeframe of a regular day trade. A true scalper rarely lets a trade run that long.
*** High Frequency: Because the profit target per trade is very small (e.g., just a few pips), the strategy requires executing a very high volume of trades throughout the day—often dozens or even hundreds—to let the small gains accumulate into a substantial daily profit.
** The Core Goal
*** The scalper's philosophy is based on the belief that small moves are easier to capture and occur more frequently than large, sustained moves.
*** Small Profit, High Volume: The trader is content with just "scalping" a tiny piece of the price movement and then quickly closing the position.
** Minimizing Risk Exposure: By holding a trade for only a few minutes or seconds, the scalper significantly reduces the risk of being caught by a sudden, large adverse move in the market.
** Key Requirements for a Scalper
*** Due to the ultra-short time frame, scalping requires:
**** Intense Focus: The trader must be glued to the screen, watching the very smallest time charts (like the 1-minute or 5-minute charts).
**** Discipline: A strict exit strategy (both profit-taking and stop-loss) is vital, as one large loss can easily wipe out the gains from many small profitable trades.
**** Fast Execution: The broker platform must be fast and reliable, as even a second's delay can cost the scalper the small edge they are looking for.
* New York Lunch Macro
** Mark 9:30 AM and 10:00 AM (opening range).
*** Observe the direction from 9:30–10:00 AM (bullish or bearish impulse).
*** If price moves one direction strongly and doesn’t run counter-side liquidity, expect retracement.
** After 10:00 AM:
*** Mark the first high (if drop) or first low (if rally).
*** Watch for the swing low/high to hold.
*** If it holds → expect retracement into premium (if bearish morning) or discount (if bullish morning) PD arrays.
*** Target → that first high/low after 10:00 AM, or the first FVG in the opening range.
** Key Time Window (10:30–11:30 AM New York Time)
*** This hour usually forms the intermediate-term higher low of the morning session.
*** It sets the stage for the New York Lunch Macro, which defines the market’s order flow direction for the next 2 hours (≈ 11:00 AM to 1:30 PM).
** Algorithm’s Role
*** The algorithm computes the range high and range low of the session.
*** It establishes the midpoint (equilibrium) — this is where balance exists between buyers and sellers.
*** Once equilibrium is defined, the algorithm determines which side of the market to target next (buy-side or sell-side).
** Price Behavior Below Equilibrium (Around 10:30 AM)
*** When price trades below equilibrium, the algorithm starts looking for sell-side liquidity (stops under lows).
*** Traders who are profitable from earlier moves become targets — the market often runs their stops during the lunch macro.
** Two Typical Scenarios During Lunch Macro
*** Shallow Liquidity Run Scenario:
*** Price dips to take the first pool of liquidity.
*** Then it consolidates for the rest of the day without making new highs or lows.
*** Deep Liquidity Run Scenario:
*** Price trades deeper, taking out sell-side stops.
*** After that stop raid, the algorithm begins accumulation and drives price higher through the afternoon.
*** This often leads to a strong close, especially into Friday’s session, closing the week on a high.
** Purpose for ICT Traders
*** Understand this structure to anticipate:
*** When to expect a retracement or accumulation phase (10:30–11:30 window).
*** Which side of liquidity the algorithm is likely to target during the lunch session (11:00–1:30).
*** Where to look for optimal FVGs and order blocks aligned with that intraday bias.
* Rule of Low Resistance Liquidity Run
** What Is a “Low Resistance Liquidity Run”?
*** A low resistance liquidity run means:
*** The algorithm is running stops (liquidity) in one direction; and afterward, price moves back in the opposite direction with little resistance — meaning there are few unfilled orders to slow it down.
*** In other words, after a liquidity grab (e.g., taking sell-side stops), price can easily rally higher because the market is “thin” in that direction.

** “Down-Close Candles Will Support Price Higher”
*** When price makes a down-close candle (a bearish candle) right before the market reverses upward, that candle often becomes a support zone.
*** Why? Because:
**** It usually represents the last effort of sellers (or stop raids) before the algorithm shifts direction.
**** Smart money left buy orders inside that candle to reaccumulate long positions.
**** So when price returns to that candle later, it tends to bounce from it.
*** Think of it like:
**** “The last bearish candle before a rally supports price on the way back.”
**** That’s why ICT says:
**** “Down close candles will support price higher.”
** “Inefficiencies Will Leave a Portion Open”
*** This refers to Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) — small imbalances or inefficiencies in price delivery.
*** When price moves sharply (displacement), it often leaves gaps between candles where not all orders were transacted.
*** The algorithm tends to revisit these imbalances later to rebalance them — but not always completely.
*** It often leaves a portion of the gap open, signaling that the move remains efficient and the directional bias (upward or downward) is still intact.
*** So:
*** “Inefficiencies will leave a portion open” = not all FVGs get fully closed; the leftover imbalance shows continuation potential.

* High resistance liquidity run
** Definition:A price move that encounters strong opposition or “resistance” after running liquidity — price cannot continue efficiently.
** Structure Behavior: Candles are overlapping, choppy, and show heavy wicks. Movement lacks clean displacement.Price struggles to sustain direction after a liquidity raid.
** Inefficiencies (FVGs): Fair Value Gaps are fully filled or rebalanced quickly. No portion of imbalance is left open → shows weakness or lack of continuation bias.
** Order Blocks: Previous order blocks fail to hold as support/resistance.Price cuts through or rejects them → signals loss of algorithmic efficiency.
** Liquidity Targeted: Usually takes internal liquidity (minor highs/lows). The move ends shortly after; it’s not a sustained trend run.
** Algorithmic Meaning: The algorithm is rebalancing inefficiencies, not seeking new highs/lows. Indicates a potential reversal, retracement, or range-bound condition.
** Visual Signature: No clean displacement. Price delivery looks “heavy” or slow, with constant pullbacks and overlap.
** Trader Implication: Avoid expecting continuation after such moves. Treat it as exhaustion, rebalancing, or distribution area.
* Original Consolidation
** Range Box Becomes Reference Structure
*** The top and bottom bounds of this consolidation box are critical levels.
*** After the liquidity sweep / expansion, price often retests back into this original consolidation range (“box”) to confirm direction.
*** The consolidation box is sometimes called the “original consolidation range / original box.” 
** Order Blocks & FVGs in Context
*** The order blocks (areas of institutional interest) and fair value gaps left during or after the consolidation are aligned relative to this box.
*** When price breaks from the consolidation, these structures become important for entries on retests.
** Role in the ICT “5-Box” / Entry Models
*** In ICT’s Model 5 (5-Box Setup), the original consolidation is step 2: after identifying the HTF POI, you observe price consolidating to form the box. 
*** Steps proceed: consolidation → liquidity sweep (aggressive move out) → retest of box → trade execution.
*** The original consolidation provides the reference box that defines the structural bounds for the entry logic.
* Step-by-Step: How Model 5 Works
**  HTF POI (Point of Interest): Identify a strong higher-timeframe level (swing high/low, order block, liquidity level); This is your anchor level — price is expected to respect or react around it.                     
**  Original Consolidation (the “Box”): As price approaches the POI, it often moves sideways, forming a range (box); Mark the high and low of that range. This box contains liquidity (stops above/below).            
** Liquidity Sweep / Aggressive Move: Price pushes outside the box — takes out stop orders above or below the box; This move is sharp, fast, and may intrude beyond the box edges to grab liquidity.                
**  Reversal / Retest into the Box: After the sweep, price often reverses and returns to retest the box area;The retest is critical — the swept edge of the box usually becomes a key support/resistance.     
** Entry & Targeting: Enter on the retest, with predefined stop and target zones; Stop beyond the liquidity sweep; targets at the opposite side of the box, or further HTF levels. |

* Two Swing highs (the same holds for swing lows)
** The left high is slightly higher than the right high.
*** This creates the visual impression that:
**** The right high is lower,
**** Traders see this as a potential double top,
**** So many expect resistance or short entries at that level.
**** This is priming — the algorithm is inspiring traders to sell near that area.
** Priming is the process where the algorithm (or smart money) creates expectations in the minds of retail traders and investors — essentially setting a trap or sympathetic side
** Sympathetic side is the side of the market where most traders’ emotions and positions are aligned — the side that’s vulnerable to being raided.
*** So:
**** If most traders expect buying, the sympathetic side is the buy-side.
**** If most expect selling, the sympathetic side is the sell-side.
*** The market maker (algorithm) uses priming to build up liquidity on that sympathetic side — then runs it.
*** “These two are trusted for buy stops... when the right side is swept before the left, you can measure that move. That’s the advantage of the framework.”
* ICT Beginner Trader Framework (in words)
** First, look for smooth defended areas on the chart.
*** These are places where price moves cleanly and seems to be repeatedly defended or rejected.
Such areas usually show institutional defense zones — where large players are active and the market is being offered in a way that attracts retail traders.
** Second, identify relatively equal highs or equal lows, where the left high is slightly higher than the right high, or the left low is slightly lower than the right low.
*** These are not real support or resistance levels — they are engineered liquidity pools designed to attract stop orders above or below them.
These areas are important because they show where the algorithm is likely to target liquidity later.
** Third, confirm that the swings, fair value gaps (FVGs), and other key structures align across three timeframes — for example, the daily, one-hour, and five-minute charts.
*** When all three agree on direction, it gives you directional confluence and a higher-probability trade idea.
** Fourth, focus on the premarket session, especially between 7:00–7:30 AM, 8:00–8:30 AM, and 9:00–9:30 AM New York time.
*** These are the windows when the market often forms a premarket range — a short consolidation where liquidity is being built up before the main move at the New York open.
This helps you define the pre-session liquidity setup.
** Fifth, when drawing your premarket range, make sure to exclude manipulation wicks — those sharp candle spikes that occur from stop-hunts.
*** Instead, use the candle bodies to define the top and bottom of the range.
This gives you accurate range boundaries that the market truly respects.
** Do not look for equal highs and equal lows prior to 7:00. Just start at 7:00 for the hunt of equal lows or highs. Start at 15m, then go to 5m then go to 1m.
*** If there is relatively equal lows below the market place, then you want to see a move the first 30 minuts go in the opposite direct. If there is relative equal highs that form after 7, 8 or 9 oclock that first 30 minutes you want to see the market drop; you want to see a measure of manipulation. 
** Quick Example (New York session)
*** Time: 8:20 a.m.
*** Price forms equal highs.
*** You wait — don’t trade yet.
*** Around 8:45, price spikes up, takes the highs (liquidity sweep).
*** Immediately after, price drops sharply → displacement down → structure breaks.
**** That’s your confirmation → look for a short at FVG or OB in the new bearish leg.
* Gaps and Relatively Highs/Lows
** Gaps (NWOG & NDOG) as Price Magnets
*** The market's opening and closing prices create powerful reference points because they represent the exact beginning and end of a defined trading period, which institutions use for accounting and order flow processing.
*** New Week Opening and Closing Gaps (NWOG/NWCG): The gap between the Friday New York Close (5:00 PM NY) and the Sunday Open (6:00 PM NY) marks a significant weekly reset. The price space within this gap is often treated as an imbalance that must eventually be filled. The transcript notes how the new week opening gap can act as support or resistance, with price respecting the levels within it [19:04].
*** New Day Opening and Closing Gaps (NDOG/NDCG): Similarly, the hourly difference between the daily close (5:00 PM NY) and the daily open (6:00 PM NY) on instruments like futures creates a daily gap. The video shows how new day opening gaps are actively traded into, with candle bodies respecting the gap's parameters [19:22].
** Consequent Encroachment (CE) and Quadrant Levels
*** The most important level within any gap is the Consequent Encroachment (CE), which is the 50% midpoint of the gap's range.
*** CE as the Core Target: The CE is the most sensitive level within the gap and acts as a powerful magnet. Price will often move to test this 50% level before continuing its overall trend. The transcript identifies the 50% level on the new week opening gap [16:32].
*** Quadrant Levels: For larger, more significant gaps, ICT also uses quadrant levels (25% and 75%) to further refine potential reversal or reaction points [17:51].
*** These levels (NWOG/NDOG/CE) are considered powerful because they are less frequent than Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) and are based on the market's calendar structure, which institutional systems prioritize.
** Relative Highs and Lows (Liquidity Targets)
*** Relative highs and lows are areas where a significant cluster of stop-loss orders and pending orders reside, creating a pool of liquidity. Price is attracted to these levels to "sweep" or "raid" the liquidity.
*** Stop Hunt Mechanism: If two or more highs are relatively equal (Relative Equal Highs - REH), price will be drawn above them to execute the buy-stop orders of short sellers, which provides the necessary fuel for a reversal or continuation.
*** The video confirms this concept, explaining that if a level (a high) acts as resistance and price returns to it, it’s not because the level is weak, but because it’s going back up to clear the stop losses of people who sold short above that high [25:02].
** Price Action Mechanics and Recommendation
*** The general rule for trading these imbalances and liquidity voids is:
*** Gap Filling: If the current price is above a gap, it is expected to move down to fill the imbalance. If the current price is below a gap, it is expected to move up to fill it.
*** Algorithmic Reference: The recommendation to consider opening gaps from the last 5 weeks and 5 days is based on the assumption that institutional algorithms maintain a rolling reference of recent, structurally significant gaps to inform their future order execution. By identifying and tracking these historical reference points, traders can better anticipate the algorithm's next likely target.
* Overlapping FVG and Weekly, Daily, ETH and NTH Gaps
** A strong / high-probability FVG is rarely “clean” by itself — it's often reinforced by overlap with another FVG (usually of a higher or adjacent timeframe). That overlapping / stacking of FVGs gives more conviction (confluence) that price will react to that zone.
** So it’s a confluence + probabilistic filter — you only take FVGs that overlap / stack with others (or show other confirmation) in order to increase your odds.
* Why this “stacking / overlapping” heuristic makes sense (the intuition)
** Here are reasons / justifications as to why many traders believe this is a useful rule:
*** Order flow / institutional footprint
**** If a strong FVG is created (strong institutional move), it's more likely that the same zone has unfilled interest from previous moves. So the “imbalance” gets compounded. Zones where multiple imbalances overlap are more attractive for institutions to defend / revisit.
*** Confluence increases probability
**** In technical analysis, levels that have multiple sources of support / resistance (FVG, prior structure, order block, liquidity zone) tend to attract more attention. An overlapping FVG adds another reason for price to react.
*** Filtering noise
**** Many “weak” fair value gaps will occur (small imbalances, weak impulses). But few of those will also align with other imbalances. So requiring overlap is a way to filter out low-probability ones.
*** Multi-timeframe alignment
**** A gap formed on a lower timeframe might be weak, but if that same price region was also a gap (or imbalance) on a higher timeframe, that gives stronger context. Traders often look for higher timeframe confluence.
*** Zone strength & liquidity
**** Gaps are seen as regions of latent liquidity. Overlap of gaps means more liquidity to be “filled” or more resting orders. Those zones may be more “powerful” in terms of reaction.
* The strongest imbalances are not random — they’re nested across multiple timeframes or sessions.
** That includes:
*** Weekly Opening Gaps (WOGs)
*** Daily Opening Gaps (DOGs)
*** Electronic Trading Hours (ETH) gaps
*** Normal Trading Hours (NTH) gaps
** All of these can overlap each other — and when they do, they create that “stacked” or “layered” inefficiency zone where smart money often responds.
** So, when those sessional or temporal gaps stack — for instance, a daily FVG forming inside a weekly FVG, or a NY open gap forming within an Asian session imbalance — ICT sees that as: “High probability reaction zone.”
* Algorithmic Symmetry
** ICT teaches that the market is not random — it’s algorithmic, meaning price delivery follows structured rules of repricing, liquidity seeking, and rebalancing.
*** So when you see a Fair Value Gap (FVG) form (especially around an algorithmic event like the 9:30 AM NY open), you can anticipate that:
*** The next displacement leg will mirror, expand, or rebalance relative to that original FVG.
*** That’s why he often says things like:
**** “The market will reprice to balance inefficiencies it created earlier.”
**** or “The next FVG often forms opposite or equal to the first, because the algorithm delivers symmetry.”
* The Common Thread — Algorithmic Overlap & Repricing Logic
** ICT’s underlying idea is this: “Price delivery is algorithmic. Every move leaves inefficiencies. When the algorithm shifts its repricing direction, it reuses, overlaps, or inverts prior inefficiencies.”
** Overlaps Are the Engine of Reversals and Continuation
*** Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG)
**** Definition: When price trades through a prior FVG and then later returns to that same area — but now it acts inversely (support → resistance, or resistance → support).
**** Overlap logic: The IFVG overlaps the tail of the previous FVG. The market leaves a new imbalance directly inside or across the old one.That overlap creates a “flip zone” where the algorithm rebalances opposite direction.
**** ICT meaning: “The algorithm reclaims that inefficiency and redefines it as a delivery point for the opposite side.”
*** Reclaimed Fair Value Gap (RFVG)
**** Definition: When an FVG that was once violated gets “reclaimed” (price returns above/below and closes back into it). Overlap logic: The reclaimed FVG sits directly on top of the old one.It forms a nested overlap where the algorithm invalidated the first imbalance but then reinstates it.
**** ICT meaning:“When a fair value gap is reclaimed, the algorithm is resetting its delivery to the original inefficiency.”
*** Breaker Block
**** Definition: A previous bullish or bearish order block that failed (i.e. was violated) and later acts as the opposite side’s support/resistance.
**** Overlap logic: The breaker block typically overlaps a prior FVG or OB from the same zone.  Its creation clears liquidity and fills an inefficiency, then reuses that area as an inverse level.
**** ICT meaning: “The breaker sits where the algorithm transitions — where the old imbalance is repurposed for the new bias.”So the breaker’s efficiency comes from overlap: it’s the junction between two opposing delivery algorithms.
*** Mitigation Block
**** Definition: A previous order block (often opposite in direction) that is revisited to “mitigate” unfilled orders before continuing trend.
**** Overlap logic: The mitigation block almost always overlaps a prior FVG, IFVG, or OB. That overlap allows the algorithm to rebalance orders (fill old longs/shorts) before continuing delivery.
**** ICT meaning: “Price returns to mitigate unfilled orders within a prior inefficiency — overlap is how the algorithm rebalances.”
* Why equal highs/lows form in overlap zones
** An overlap zone (where a bearish and bullish breaker block meet) is an area of:
** Previous liquidity delivery (price has traded there in both directions),
** Institutional rebalancing (inefficiencies filled from both sides),
** Unresolved liquidity (orders still resting there).
** Because both buyers and sellers view that zone as important, price tends to stall there — forming relatively equal highs or lows as the algorithm builds liquidity.
** Example: Overlap zone above price
*** You had a bearish breaker block (from a failed rally).
*** Later, the same region was reclaimed as a bullish breaker (price closed above it).
*** Now that overlapping region sits as a dual-identity zone — both supply and demand in memory.
*** When price revisits it, the algorithm often:
**** Creates two equal highs just under that zone.
**** Engineers buy-side liquidity above.
**** Then sweeps it to deliver price back into the breaker for a true move.
**** So those equal highs form because the market is coiling liquidity before it decides which side of the overlap to respect.
**** Same logic for equal lows
* The 9:30–10:00 AM Fair Value Gap (Opening Range Powerhouse)
** Time Window: 9:30–10:00 AM (Real Opening Range)
** Key Structure: First Fair Value Gap (Powerhouse)
** Duration of Influence: Until ~3:45 PM NY Time
** Discount Opening: FVG forms below previous day’s close
** Midpoint Rule: 70% chance price trades back to midpoint
** Inversion FVG: Forms after midpoint reaction, adds confluence
** Above FVG Close: Bullish continuation
** Below Midpoint: Leads to full gap closure (bearish rebalancing)
** For London session opening range is formed between 1:50 and 2:10 am NY time.
* Intraday Old lows and highs (3 days) as reference for algorism
** Reference Points (3-Day Lookback):
*** Always consider up to the previous three days’ highs and lows.
*** The algorithm uses these as reference points for liquidity and range definition.
** Intraday Range Context:
*** When trading today, note if price is still inside the range formed by the highest high and lowest low of the past few days.
*** This helps you know whether the market is still accumulating or distributing before a breakout.
** Intraday Low Behavior:
*** If an intraday low forms within that higher-timeframe range (and hasn’t made a new lower low yet), it signals potential partial profits or reaction points, not full reversals.
** Partial Management Logic:
*** When price first pierces below the previous day’s low, do not take partials immediately.
*** Wait for price to retrace back up toward the previous day’s low (using it as a reference point).
** Optimal Partial Taking:
*** Once price drops again below the previous day’s low (the second break), that new low is where your initial partial should be taken.
*** Then you can decide how much of the position to reduce or hold based on bias and drawdown tolerance.
** Core Idea:
*** The algorithm seeks liquidity beneath previous lows or above previous highs, especially from the last three days.
*** Smart traders align their entry, partial, and continuation plans with how price interacts with those reference points.
* Seek and Destroy
** Lack of Clear Direction: The price action exhibits market indecision and a lack of a clear directional bias on higher timeframes, often leading to consolidation (choppy, range-bound movement).
** Liquidity Sweep: During this phase, the market aggressively moves to "seek" and "destroy" liquidity by running stop losses (stop-loss orders placed by traders) on both sides of the market (both above swing highs and below swing lows) without establishing a sustained, definitive trend.
** Whipsaw Action: This results in erratic, unpredictable price swings (whipsaws) that often trap retail traders who enter on false breakouts.
** Low Probability Trading: Traders using ICT concepts are generally advised to avoid aggressive trading or breakout strategies during a Seek and Destroy day due to the low probability of clean, sustained moves.
** The S&D profile often occurs when the market is anticipating or waiting for a major high-impact economic event (like Non-Farm Payroll or FOMC) and may consolidate for several days leading up to the news.
* Premarket Concepts
** Def: a set of principles and analytical steps used to establish a directional bias and identify high-probability trade setups before a major market session, particularly the New York trading session.
** Daily Bias Determination
*** The premarket routine starts by determining the Daily Bias—the expected direction of the price for the day—based on analysis of higher timeframe (HTF) charts. This involves identifying key levels like old highs and lows, and major Order Blocks or Fair Value Gaps (FVG) that the price is likely to be attracted to or repelled from.
** According to ICT, premarket refers to the period before the main session’s algorithmic draw on liquidity begins.
*** HTF like weekly and Daily
*** For New York session, this means roughly 7:00 AM – 9:30 AM (New York time).
*** For London session, it’s 2:00 AM – 5:00 AM (New York time).
*** This is not a random time — ICT teaches that these windows are when algorithms engineer liquidity, setting up traps for later runs.
** Liquidity & Imbalance Identification
*** The market structure analysis focuses on locating two main things in the premarket phase:
** Liquidity Pools: Identifying areas where retail traders have clustered their stop-loss orders. These are often above previous session highs (Buy-Side Liquidity - BSL) or below previous session lows (Sell-Side Liquidity - SSL). The market, driven by algorithms, will often sweep this liquidity to fill institutional orders.
** Fair Value Gaps (FVG): Locating price inefficiencies, or gaps, left by previous sharp moves. These imbalances are considered "magnets" that the price is likely to revisit and mitigate (fill) during the active session.
** Key Levels to Mark
*** Premarket high
*** Premarket low
*** Equilibrium of that range (the midpoint)
*** Any FVGs or Order Blocks formed
**** These levels often act as magnets or reversal points once the main session (9:30 AM NY open) begins.
* Mapping High Timeframe PD Arrays to Lower Timeframes
** High Timeframe (HTF) for Bias and Targets
*** Monthly/Weekly: These charts define the long-term market structure and key liquidity objectives (like "Old High or low" and major Liquidity Voids) that the market is likely aiming for over weeks or months. They give you the broadest sense of the overall trend and where the significant institutional money is flowing.
*** Daily: This is often the Intermediate Timeframe that confirms the directional bias from the Weekly/Monthly and provides the most relevant PD Arrays (Order Blocks, Breaker Blocks, Fair Value Gaps) that the price is currently reacting to or is expected to react to in the coming days.
** Lower Timeframe (LTF) for Execution
*** Once you've identified a significant HTF PD Array (e.g., a Weekly Order Block or a Daily Fair Value Gap), you wait for the price to trade into it. When it does, you zoom down to a lower timeframe (e.g., 4-hour, 1-hour, 15-minute) to look for a Market Structure Shift (MSS) or a similar entry model confirmation to execute the trade.
** Reliability and Confluence
*** The higher the timeframe on which a PD Array is formed, the more significant and reliable it is considered. A Weekly Fair Value Gap is a much more powerful draw on price than a 15-minute one.
*** Confluence is key: A trade setup is strongest when a Daily PD Array lines up exactly with a Weekly PD Array's mean threshold (50% line) or if an entry on the 15-minute chart is taken at a PD Array that is nested within a Daily PD Array.
*** The high timeframes provide the roadmap (where price is going), and the lower timeframes provide the GPS coordinates (where exactly to enter).
* ICT’s precision-based trading philosophy
** Market Orders Show You Are “Chasing Price”
*** ICT says market orders reveal impatience — they show that you’re reacting to price, not anticipating it.
*** A market order executes immediately at the best available price, but that means you’re buying when the price is already high or selling when it’s already low.
*** It often happens after displacement or after a liquidity run, when smart money is already positioned and preparing for a retracement.
** Limit Orders Align with “Precision Entries”
*** ICT wants you to think like Smart Money, not the herd.
*** Smart Money does not chase candles. They wait for price to come back into a level of interest — like:
**** A Fair Value Gap (FVG)
**** A Breaker Block
**** A Mitigation Block
**** An Order Block (OB)
*** Those areas represent discounts (for buys) or premiums (for sells) relative to the current move.
*** A limit order is placed ahead of time at one of these key levels — meaning:
*** You already know where price should react if your bias is correct.
*** That makes your entry:
**** Planned
**** Precise
**** Risk-defined
** Limit Orders Give Better Risk-to-Reward
*** ICT’s entries are structured around tight stops and high R multiples.
*** Using a limit order:
**** You get in at a better price (near the OB or FVG)
**** Your stop loss is tighter (below/above the structure)
**** You maximize the R:R ratio because entry is closer to invalidation
** “Set it and Wait” — Smart Money Behavior
*** ICT wants traders to adopt a mechanical, unemotional entry method:
*** Identify setup
*** Place limit order at your PD Array (FVG, OB, etc.)
*** Walk away — let price come to you
*** This creates discipline and detachment — two key psychological edges in ICT methodology.
* The "First Presented Fair Value Gap" (FVG)
*** What it is: The "first presented fair value gap" is identified as a 1-minute FVG that forms immediately after the 9:31 AM ET market open and is typically preceded by a raid on prior session liquidity (e.g., relative equal highs or lows) [00:12:56].
*** Purpose: This specific 1-minute FVG is the setup that a trader should use to engage the market's directional bias for the morning session (9:30 to 10:00 AM) [00:08:31].
** The Large Opening Premium/Discount Gap / Opening Range Gap
*** What it is: This refers to the large price difference between the previous day's settlement (4:15 PM ET) and the 9:30 AM ET opening price when viewed on the Regular Trading Hours (RTH) chart.
*** Relationship to the FVG: While the market action that creates the "First Presented FVG" (the 1-minute gap) occurs within the context of the large Opening Range Gap, the large gap itself is used to identify a major draw on liquidity.
*** Key Level: ICT states that when a large Opening Range Gap occurs, you should immediately measure the gap to find its Consequent Encroachment (CE), which is the 50% midpoint [00:13:18]. He teaches there is a 70% likelihood that price will pull back into that 50% level of the Opening Range Gap [00:13:24].
* The ICT Gauntlet
*** The Gauntlet is a precise pattern used for high-confidence entries:
*** It is identified as the very lowest first Sell-side Imbalance By-side Efficiency (CIBBY/bullish FVG) found within the price leg of a bullish breaker pattern-[00:15:56].
*** It is specifically used after a pool of liquidity has been taken out at a swing low.
*** The Gauntlet is the specific FVG you look for when the market reverses after raiding that liquidity, confirming the entry for the resulting bullish move-[00:16:13].
* Key Aspects of the 9:50 AM Macro
** The Time Window: The macro is typically observed from 9:50 AM EST to 10:10 AM EST (New York time). While your query specified 10:00 AM, the official macro window extends for a full 20 minutes.
** Algorithmic Purpose: A "macro" is a short order of instructions that the algorithm runs to either:
** Seek/Sweep Liquidity: The algorithm will aggressively move price to take out resting stop-losses (liquidity) that have been built up, especially after the New York Stock Exchange opens at 9:30 AM EST.
** Fill Inefficiencies (FVGs): Price will rapidly move to rebalance or fill any large market inefficiencies, known as Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), created by earlier market expansion.
** Significance: It is considered a high-probability window because it often follows the initial volatile move after the 9:30 AM open. Traders use this time to look for specific entry setups, with the most famous being the ICT Silver Bullet strategy, which often occurs around this time after a liquidity sweep has been completed.
* Turtle Soup and Opening Gaps/Ranges
** Turtle Soup
*** The "Turtle Soup" setup, as described in ICT, refers to a specific type of liquidity grab or false breakout.
*** It suggests that the market may deliberately move slightly below a significant old low (a swing low) in a bullish scenario, or slightly above a significant old high (a swing high) in a bearish scenario, only to immediately reverse. This movement is designed to trap traders who placed stop-loss orders just beyond those old highs/lows (liquidity).
*** The ICT concept adds that this liquidity-sweeping move—the Turtle Soup—can be targeting an area that aligns with or extends to:
** Opening Gaps
**** New Week Opening Gap (NWOG): The difference between the previous week's closing price and the new week's opening price. Price might move to "fill" or react to this gap.
**** New Day Opening Gap (NDOG): The difference between the previous day's closing price and the new day's opening price.
**** Opening Range (OR) / New Day Opening Range (NDOR): The price range established during a specific, usually short, period (e.g., the first 30 or 60 minutes) of a new trading day.
*** In essence, the Turtle Soup move below an old low or above an old high acts as a catalyst to push price into a key area like a NWOG, NDOG, or OR/NDOR, where the true directional move (the reversal) is expected to begin.
** Price Action Movement to Premium or Discount: Reasons for movement
*** Sweeping Liquidity (Liquidity Grab)
**** Bullish Scenario: If the overall trend is bullish, price will often dip into the discount side of a range to grab sell-side liquidity (stop-losses below lows, or existing limit buy orders) before resuming the upward move. This is seen as smart money "filling their tanks" at a favorable price.
**** Bearish Scenario: If the overall trend is bearish, price will often rally into the premium side of a range to grab buy-side liquidity (stop-losses above highs, or existing limit sell orders) before continuing the decline. Smart money is seen "distributing" their positions at a higher price.
*** Rebalance Inefficiencies (Filling Voids)
*** The market seeks to be "fairly priced." When price moves quickly, it often leaves behind areas of inefficiency or imbalance, which ICT terms "Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)" or "Liquidity Voids."
**** Bullish Scenario (Movement to Discount): Price moves down into the discount to re-price or fill a previously created inefficiency (like an FVG) before the bullish trend continues. The FVG acts as a magnet and a likely point of support.
**** Bearish Scenario (Movement to Premium): Price moves up into the premium to re-price or fill a previously created inefficiency before the bearish trend resumes. The FVG acts as a magnet and a likely point of resistance.
*** In summary, price moving to discount for buying or premium for selling is done either to trap retail traders (sweeping liquidity) or to correct an imbalance in the price delivery (rebalancing inefficiencies).
* Venom Model
** Components
***  Time: There’s a key window (specifically for U.S. session models) — typically the “initial range” or “box” between about 08:00-09:30 AM U.S. New York time.
*** Liquidity zones / sweeps: Price moves to clear stop-losses (liquidity) either above recent highs or below recent lows, then reverses. This liquidity grab is the “trap” for retail traders.
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS) / Break of Structure (BOS) / Change in State of Delivery (CISD): After the liquidity sweep, you look for a structural change in the market – e.g., lower high → lower low (for bearish) or higher low → higher high (for bullish) – which gives confirmation.
*** Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) / Order Blocks / Imbalance zones: These mark areas where price moved too fast and left an inefficiency, which then tends to get revisited. The model uses these as precision entry zones.
*** Bias / setup quality: The model emphasises trading one clear setup rather than many weak ones — i.e., discipline, waiting for the clean conditions.
*** How you might apply it (step-by-step)
** How you might apply it (step-by-step)
*** Determine the initial range/time-window — e.g., for U.S. session systems, mark the high and low from ~08:00-09:30 NY time. (If you trade gold during the Asian session, you’d adapt the window to your session/time zone.) 
*** Identify potential liquidity sweep — watch for price poking above the range high (for bearish setup) or below the range low (for bullish setup) and triggering stops.
*** Wait for Market Structure Shift — after liquidity is taken, look for a clear shift (e.g., a BOS) confirming reversal intention.
*** Locate your entry zone — typically in or around a FVG/order block that has been created as part of the structure. This gives a favourable risk-reward entry.
*** Manage risk and target — Stop-loss is placed relative to the liquidity sweep point or structure. Target may be the opposite side of initial range, or next liquidity pool. Some backtests show 1:2 risk:reward setups.
*** Session/time awareness — The model emphasises trade timing (liquidity is higher and moves more “institutional” at certain hours).
*** Bias & context — Always check higher timeframe context and whether the session/liquidity conditions are favourable. If the model conditions are weak, it’s better not to trade.
* ICT’s New York Session Ranges and Macros
** Opening range and Macros
*** 9:30 – 10:00 AM-Opening Range: The true New York equities open; creates the daily reference range. Price forms an initial high/low boundary from which liquidity is engineered.
*** 9:50 – 10:10 AM-Macro (AM): The “macro” window. Algorithm uses this to confirm direction — either expand above or below the opening range to engineer liquidity grabs. This gives directional bias for the rest of the morning.
*** 11:30 AM – 1:30 PM-Lunch Macro (Midday Macro): Slow time. Algorithms rebalance price inside the existing range. Often forms reversal setups or retracements into premium/discount zones before the PM move.
*** 1:30 – 2:00 PM-Closing Opening Range (PM Opening Range):New impulse window as the algorithm starts the PM leg. Often a new range is defined that leads into the afternoon expansion.
*** 2:50 – 3:10 PM-Macro (PM):Final “macro window.” The algorithm makes its last liquidity run — a stop raid, continuation, or reversal — before equities close. The daily range often completes here.
** What ICT Means by “Opening Ranges Set a Trading Field”
*** When ICT says that “opening ranges set the trading fields from or to which price action moves,” he means: The range formed during 9:30–10:00 AM becomes the structural framework of the day’s price delivery.
*** The algorithm references this early range to decide:
**** where to engineer liquidity (above/below it),
**** where to expand price,
**** and where to later return or rebalance.
*** In other words: The opening range defines the boundaries of the algorithm’s playground — the price will often move from one side of that field to the other as it seeks liquidity.
** How This Plays Out Intraday
*** Example scenario:
**** 9:30–10:00 → Market forms opening range. Suppose high = 2380 and low = 2365 on XAU/USD.
**** 9:50–10:10 → Price runs below 2365, taking out early long stops (liquidity grab).
**** After that raid, the algorithm shifts bullish → price rallies back above 2365, showing displacement.
*** That run defines the daily direction.
**** During lunch macro (11:30–1:30), price consolidates or retraces back toward equilibrium.
**** 1:30–2:00 → A new impulse range forms; price expands again, completing the day’s profile.
**** 2:50–3:10 → The final macro may do a small stop run or complete the daily move.
**** So the “trading field” is the dynamic zone between the boundaries created in those key time blocks.
** Key Takeaways
*** Opening ranges = algorithmic anchor points.
*** Macros = expansion or liquidity grab windows.
*** Lunch macro = retracement/consolidation.
*** PM opening range = second leg development.
*** PM macro = daily range completion.
*** Price moves from one range to the next, often reacting at those time windows because that’s when the algorithm delivers new liquidity objectives.
* London Session Opening Range and Macros
** 1:00 – 2:00 AM NY-Pre-London Session-The pre-session engineering phase. The algorithm begins raiding Asian liquidity — running stops above or below the Asian range (00:00–05:00 London). It’s where inducements form just before the true London open (7:00). Liquidity pools are set and traps are built.
** 2:00 – 2:30 AM NY-London Opening Range-The true-London equities open: Price defines the *European reference range* that the algorithm will use for the morning. Expect initial liquidity grabs around Asian highs/lows and the creation of a session high/low boundary. |
** 2:50 – 3:10 AM NY-London AM Macro-The first “macro window.”:  The algorithm chooses expansion direction — it will either run liquidity above or below the opening range to confirm bias. This sets the tone for the rest of the London morning.                        |
** 4:30 – 5:30 AM NY-London Mid-Session Macro: Typically a rebalancing or continuation phase. Algorithms consolidate or retrace back into premium/discount areas of the morning move. Ideal for internal range scalps and FVG re-entries.                                         |
** 6:00 – 6:30 AM NY-London PM Opening Range: The start of the London PM leg. Often a new impulse window leading into the *New York pre-market*. Watch for displacement and structure shifts; sets the bias before NY liquidity joins.                                           |
** 7:50 – 8:10 AM NY-London PM Macro (Transition Macro): Final macro of the London session. Algorithm executes last liquidity grabs or reversals before handing price behavior over to New York. Often creates the *daily kill zone hand-off* setup.                                       
* Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) often forms between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM NY tim
** Time-Based Logic (Liquidity & Algorithm Behavior)
*** Between 8:30 and 11:00 AM NY time, several important things happen:
*** 8:30 AM — Major U.S. economic news releases (e.g., CPI, NFP, GDP, etc.). These cause sharp liquidity grabs.
*** 9:30 AM — New York Stock Exchange opens, creating volatility and a true “price delivery” range.
*** 10:00–10:30 AM — Liquidity is often engineered and then price reverses toward the daily dealing range.
*** The Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) typically occurs after liquidity is taken and a displacement confirms direction.
** How the OTE Forms
*** The OTE is based on Fibonacci retracement and market structure shift:
**** Identify a swing high to swing low (for a buy setup) or swing low to swing high (for a sell setup) after a displacement.
**** Measure the retracement with Fibonacci.
**** The OTE zone is between the 61.8% and 79% retracement levels.
**** Price retraces into this area after a liquidity grab, then resumes the trend.
**** This pattern commonly completes between 8:30 AM and 11:00 AM because:
**** By then, the Asian and London sessions have set liquidity pools.
**** The New York session provides the “smart money” opportunity to enter at a discount (for buys) or a premium (for sells).
* ICT Trading Models (NY Time Reference)
** Silver Bullet Model
*** Core Focus: Precision time-based model designed to capture algorithmic price delivery after liquidity sweeps.
*** Time Windows:
**** 3:00 AM – 4:00 AM → London Open window
**** 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM → New York AM session
**** 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM → New York PM session
**** Setup Logic: Liquidity raid → Displacement → Fair Value Gap → Entry → Opposite liquidity target.
**** Notes: One clean trade per chosen hour; highly structured and mechanical.
** Venom Model
*** Core Focus: Institutional manipulation and reversal model centered on stop hunts around the New York open.
*** Time Window: 8:00 AM – 9:30 AM (the “Venom Box”).
*** Setup Logic: Wait for liquidity sweep during the Venom Box → market structure shift → FVG entry in the opposite direction.
*** Notes: Designed to capture the post–9:30 AM expansion move in equities and USD pairs.
** ICT 2022 Model
*** Core Focus: Modern framework combining all ICT concepts into one repeatable entry model.
*** Time Window: 8:30 AM – 11:00 AM.
*** Setup Logic: Liquidity raid → Displacement → FVG retrace entry → Target liquidity.
*** Notes: Flagship ICT model for day traders; built on precision and time discipline.
** Power of Three (PO3)
*** Core Focus: Institutional price delivery pattern — Accumulation → Manipulation → Distribution.
*** Time Frame: Typically plays out across the entire trading day.
*** Setup Logic: Identify daily bias → watch pre-session accumulation → trade the post-manipulation move.
*** Notes: Foundation of ICT’s daily bias logic and algorithmic understanding.
** Unicorn Model
*** Core Focus: High-probability alignment of multiple ICT confluences (OTE + OB + FVG + Liquidity Sweep).
*** Time Window: Not fixed; often occurs during high-volatility kill zones (London 2:00–5:00 AM, NY 8:30–11:00 AM).
*** Setup Logic: Price sweeps liquidity → creates displacement → aligns OTE retracement with OB/FVG → entry toward draw on liquidity.
*** Notes: A rare “perfect storm” setup with extremely high probability.
** Turtle Soup
*** Core Focus: Reversal model that trades false breakouts of previous highs or lows (liquidity grabs).
*** Time Window: Common during session opens or around key liquidity levels.
*** Setup Logic: Price takes previous high/low → fails to continue → confirm reversal → enter opposite direction.
*** Notes: Counter-trend entry based on liquidity exhaustion.
** Judas Swing (London/NY Killzone Model)
*** Core Focus: Identify and fade the “false move” at the session open.
*** Time Windows:
*** London: 2:00 AM – 5:00 AM
*** New York: 8:30 AM – 11:00 AM
*** Setup Logic: Early session stop hunt → market structure shift → continuation in opposite direction.
*** Notes: Often overlaps with Silver Bullet and ICT 2022 setups.
** Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)
*** Core Focus: Precision retracement entry after displacement.
*** Time Window: Flexible; typically aligns with kill zones.
*** Setup Logic: Use Fibonacci retracement (62%–79%) → look for OB/FVG confluence → entry toward bias direction.
*** Notes: A core entry concept, not time-bound but frequently part of other models.
** Asian Range / London Expansion Model
*** Core Focus: Use Asian session consolidation as a base for London session expansion.
*** Time Window:
*** Asian: 7:00 PM – 12:00 AM
*** London expansion: 2:00 AM – 5:00 AM
*** Setup Logic: Price consolidates in Asia → London sweeps one side → reverses → trades toward opposite liquidity.
*** Notes: Classic ICT London continuation/reversal play.
** SMT Divergence Model
*** Core Focus: Detect smart money divergence between correlated pairs (e.g., EUR/USD vs GBP/USD).
*** Time Window: Not fixed; best near session opens when both pairs are active.
*** Setup Logic: One pair makes a higher high while the other fails → indicates hidden distribution or accumulation → trade reversal.
*** Notes: Confirms high-probability reversals.
* Silver bullet time windows (High probability setups)
** NY session
*** 9:00-10:00 am
*** 10:00-11:00 am
*** 2:00-3:00 pm
** London session
*** 3:00-4:00am 
* MMXM	Market Maker Model: A complete institutional price delivery cycle, which typically includes accumulation, manipulation (or engineered liquidity), and distribution (or an aggressive move). It's a patterned movement that institutional traders use to enter and exit large positions efficiently.
** Original Consolidation: The first phase in a Market Maker Model or Power of Three cycle.This is the initial sideways price action where "smart money" is quietly accumulating their positions (buying or selling) before the main move. Retail traders are often trapped by the eventual breakout.
** Distribution: A phase in the Market Maker Model.The stage where "smart money" aggressively moves the price in their intended direction and begins to unload their positions to the retail traders who are now chasing the move. It represents the final, strong directional push.
** Redistribution: A phase that occurs after an initial distribution.This is a consolidation period that occurs within a larger trend, indicating that the "smart money" is taking a pause to either add to their existing positions or transfer positions to other large players before continuing the strong move. It's a continuation pattern.
** MSS	Market Structure Shift: A pattern that signals a potential change in the current trend (reversal). It occurs when the price breaks decisively (with displacement) through a significant swing high (in a downtrend) or swing low (in an uptrend), suggesting that the market's internal structure is shifting.
** SMR	Smart Money Reversal: The first stage of a Market Maker Model (MMXM).
* Accumulation-Manipulation-Distribution: Exact Mapping to LONDON and NEW YORK Sessions
** LONDON SESSION (2:00–5:00 AM NY Time)
*** Accumulation (Asian Range): 8:00 PM–12:00 AM NY (Asia)
**** Price usually creates equal highs/lows here.
**** This is your “true accumulation” most days.
*** Manipulation (London Judas Swing): Occurs 2:00–3:00 AM NY time
**** London sweeps Asian HIGH → then goes down
**** London sweeps Asian LOW → then goes up
**** This sweep is the manipulation.
*** Distribution
**** 3:00–5:00 AM NY time
**** After the Judas swing, price begins a strong trend:
**** Distribution continues until New York pre-session begins.
** NEW YORK SESSION (8:30–11:30 AM NY Time)
*** Accumulation: Happens during:
**** 7:00–8:30 AM NY
**** Pre-NY range
**** Revisits London’s range
**** Consolidation before news
*** Manipulation: Occurs at:
**** 8:30 AM (news)
**** 9:30 AM (NYSE open)
**** 10:00 AM (macro data release)
**** NY will usually sweep:
***** London high OR
***** New York pre-session high
***** Then reverse with displacement.
*** Distribution
**** From:
**** 9:30–11:00 AM
**** Or extended into 1:00 PM
**** This is when New York delivers the true trend of the day.

* Turtle Soup Model and Smart Money Reversals
*** The fundamental idea is that as a Turtle Soup Model Trader, you are framing your entries around a Smart Money Reversal (SMR).
*** Turtle Soup: This is a classic setup where price aggressively moves past a previous, obvious high or low (liquidity pool), triggering the stop-losses of breakout traders or the entry of late trend-followers, only to immediately reverse. Smart Money (market makers/institutional traders) often uses this liquidity (the "soup") to enter their position opposite to the crowd.
*** Smart Money Reversal (SMR): This is the fractal (smaller, repeating pattern) part of a larger Market Maker Buy/Sell Model (MMBM/MMSM). It represents the exact turning point where the larger move is initiated.
** Low-Risk Entry Mechanism (The SMR)
*** The SMR is identified by one of two specific Price Delivery (PD) Array patterns:
*** Inversion Fair Value Gap (Inversion FVG): An existing Fair Value Gap (FVG - a three-candle space/inefficiency) that has been traded through and then acts as support or resistance upon the first retest.
*** First Presented Fair Value Gap (FVG): The very first FVG that appears after the market has turned or the curve (reversal) begins.
*** This SMR provides the initial low-risk entry point, framing the reason for taking the trade and representing the "First Stage Accumulation" (in a Buy Model) or "Distribution" (in a Sell Model).
** The "Unicorn" Setup: Second Stage Reaccumulation/Redistribution
*** If you miss the initial SMR entry, or if you want a higher-conviction, high-momentum setup, you wait for the market to confirm the reversal and then look for the second stage. This is referred to as the "Unicorn" setup.
*** Logic: Wait for the market to complete its initial move ("deliver") away from the SMR.
*** Entry: The trade is taken on the first retracement back down into inefficiency (like an FVG or Order Block). This retracement is the "Second Stage Reaccumulation" (in a Buy Model) or "Redistribution" (in a Sell Model).
*** The Power of the Unicorn: This stage is highly anticipated because, once it forms, the move is expected to be immediate, quick, and powerful ("goes off to the races") as it sweeps up remaining liquidity. It’s considered "big bang for your buck" due to the high probability and high reward potential.
** Trade Management and Conviction
*** The lecture stresses that understanding the stages of the Market Maker Model is crucial for conviction and trade management.
*** Price Action Rules for Retracements:
*** When the price retraces against you (e.g., in the second stage):
*** Wicks and Inefficiencies: Grade them. You expect price to penetrate these areas, but how it does so is key.
*** Consequent Encroachment (CE): This is the 50% midpoint of any PD array (like an FVG or Order Block). It must be respected.
*** Acceptable Retracement: The bodies of the candles are allowed to only close in the upper half (above the CE) of the gap, wick, or inefficiency. Wicks can drop lower to scare you ("traverse by their wicks"), but the closing price (the body) must hold the upper half.
*** Warning Sign: If a candle body closes below the Consequent Encroachment (CE) of the relevant PD array, it signals a deeper risk. The advice is to cut half the position if your position size allows for it.
*** Model Failure: The lecture asserts that the Second Stage Reaccumulation in an MMBM should never trade back down through once it forms. If it does, the model is wrong, and you should be stopped out. "Second stage reaccumulation in a market maker buy model never gets a stop hunt on it. It never does."
** Stop-Loss Management (Working Class Hero Model):
*** The method emphasizes tight, aggressive stop-loss management to lock in unrealized potential:
*** Initial Setup: You enter long and your stop-loss is placed below the relevant low (e.g., below the SMR low).
*** Move Stop to Breakeven/Lock-in Profit: Once the trade moves higher and creates the first new swing low after your entry, the stop-loss is moved up immediately right below that new low. This locks in a guaranteed profit (or at least breakeven), managing your risk actively.
* A daily bullish candle's top wick is treated like an internal gap.
** When price returns:
*** It rejects the very top (1.0).
*** It finds support sequentially at 0.25 → 0.50 → 0.75.
*** After internal rebalancing, it breaks upward strongly.
*** This is ICT’s demonstration that “wicks are inefficiencies” and price fills them with a mechanical, step-wise pattern.
** A DR is used to map premium/discount, liquidity, support/resistance, and consolidation behavior so you can anticipate where the algorithm will send price next.
* A. Monday of NFP Week (Monday Before NFP Friday)
** Purpose: Monday during NFP week often gives a high-probability Judas Swing to set the week’s bias.
*** Rules
**** Expect a Judas Swing during AM session (NY 8:30–10:00). Look for:
**** Liquidity raid → return inside range
**** Previous day’s high/low taking
**** PD Array (FVG/OB) for reversal
* B. Wednesday Before NFP Friday (The High-Probability Day)
** Wednesday is the most important day in NFP week.
*** Expect a clean algorithmic setup because:
*** Liquidity builds Mon–Tue
*** Smart money positions before Friday
* Trade on Premarket sessions if no high/medium impact news
** No high/medium impact news
** Trade from 7-8:30
** Avoid trading after 9:30
* Trade after 9:30 if there are high/medium news impact on 8:30
* Why the First FVG After 9:30 Is Important as Enty (for 9:00-10 am and 1:30-2:00 pm NY session and for 1:30-2:00 am London session)
** Creates a Judas swing (a false move to grab liquidity)
** Shows the true direction (displacement) after that liquidity grab
*** But only if these conditions are met:
**** Price must take liquidity first
***** Before the FVG is reliable, the move right after must take:
- A previous swing high/low
- A session liquidity pool
- Equal highs/lows
- A buy-side or sell-side pocket
- If liquidity is not taken first, the FVG is lower probability.
**** There must be displacement
***** The move that creates the FVG should be:
- Strong
- One-directional
- Breaking structure (BMS / SMR)
- Weak displacement = weak FVG.
**** The FVG must be the first clean one
***** ICT emphasizes “first clean FVG after the turn” because:
- It usually marks the algorithm’s chosen direction
- It provides a low-risk entry
- The stop can be placed below/above the swing that was used for liquidity
FIRST: The Rule of FVG Validity (ICT Core Requirements)
* A valid FVG must come from:
** Liquidity grab (take a high/low first)
** Displacement (strong, fast, one-directional move)
** Market structure shift (SMR/BMS)
** Reasonable FVG size (not too wide)
** The FIRST FVG after the turn (the one ICT always prefers)
*** If ANY of these 5 are missing → type invalid or low-quality FVG.
* The three macros of the day
** Midnight – 1:00 a.m. NY Time → “The Midnight Macro”
** 10:50 – 11:10 a.m. NY Time → “The Benediction Macro” (ICT’s Power of 3 Late Session Move)
** The Final Hour (3:00 – 4:00 p.m. NY) → “PM Session Macro”
* The 4 PRICE LEVELS that keep your bias perfect-These four numbers alone tell you 70% of the daily bias:
** ⃣ Midnight Open
*** Direction relative to midnight shows intraday delivery:
*** Above midnight = bullish intention
*** Below midnight = bearish intention
** ️⃣ Yesterday’s Equilibrium (50%)
*** This one level tells you:
*** If today opened in premium or discount
*** Whether early move is Judas or distribution
*** Whether the day is likely trending or mean-reverting
** ️⃣ Yesterday’s High
** ️⃣ Yesterday’s Low
** ⭐ ONLY AFTER you have these four do you look at:
*** Opening gap high/low
*** First displacement
*** Session timing (London, NYO, 9:30, etc.)
*** Now the time makes sense because it's anchored to price.
* Putting it together: Your new ICT workflow
** Here is the simplest and most accurate bias workflow ICT traders use (copy/paste this):
** Step 1 — Write 4 prices on paper (not on chart):
*** Midnight open
*** Yesterday’s equilibrium
*** Yesterday’s high
*** Yesterday’s low
** Step 2 — Compare today’s open to equilibrium
*** If open > EQ → expect first move = down
*** If open < EQ → expect first move = up
*** You already saw how you misread this today.
** Step 3 — Compare price to midnight
*** Above midnight → bullish pressure
*** Below midnight → bearish pressure
*** This tells you intraday orderflow.
** Step 4 — Identify the draw on liquidity
*** Which is closer?
*** Yesterday high? (buyside)
*** Yesterday low? (sellside)
*** This gives you the day’s “magnet”.
** Step 5 — FIRST displacement decides the direction
*** Not the retracement.
*** Not the Judas.
*** Not the time of day.
*** The FIRST displacement confirms the model
* ICT Definition of Displacement
** A move is a displacement only if it:
*** takes liquidity
*** expands away with speed (acceleration)
*** breaks a structural level (swing high or swing low)
***  usually leaves an imbalance/FVG
*** If there is no BOS →
*** It is just volatility, not displacement.
* ICT DAILY BIAS CHECKLIST
(Use this every morning before trading)
** STEP 1 — Mark the 5 Key Levels
*** Midnight Open (00:00 NY)
*** London Open (02:00 NY)
*** NY Open (8:30 NY)
*** Yesterday’s High (PDH)
*** Yesterday’s Low (PDL)
*** Yesterday’s Equilibrium (EQ = (High + Low)/2)
These 6 levels run the entire day.
** STEP 2 — Identify the Day Type Using Midnight vs EQ
This alone determines 70% of the bias.
*** If Midnight Open < Yesterday’s EQ → BULLISH DAY
**** → Algorithm wants to deliver to buy side
**** → Expect raid on PDH
**** → Expect NY Judas down, then expansion up
*** If Midnight Open > Yesterday’s EQ → BEARISH DAY
**** → Algorithm wants to deliver to sell side
**** → Expect raid on PDL
**** → Expect NY Judas up, then expansion down
** STEP 3 — Confirm With London Open
*** London gives confirmation of direction:
Bullish confirmation:
**** London Open > Midnight → accumulation below → bullish continuation
Bearish confirmation:
**** London Open < Midnight → distribution above → bearish continuation
If London is opposite, expect range or delayed Judas.
** STEP 4 — Final Confirmation From 8:30 NY Open
*** The MOST important confirmation.
Bullish NY Session:
**** 8:30 open > Midnight
**** → Favor longs
**** → Expect Judas down
**** → Expansion to PDH
Bearish NY Session:
**** 8:30 open < Midnight
**** → Favor shorts
**** → Expect Judas up
**** → Expansion to PDL
This is EXACTLY where most traders lose — they ignore where 8:30 is relative to midnight.

** STEP 5 — What You Should Expect Based on Bias
*** ⭐ Bullish Day Expectations
**** Judas swing down between 8:30–9:30
**** Entry after BOS + FVG in discount
**** First target = EQ
**** Final target = PDH
**** Overshoot levels = inefficiencies above PDH

*** ⭐ Bearish Day Expectations
**** Judas swing up into premium
**** Entry after BOS + FVG
**** First target = EQ
**** Final target = PDL
**** Overshoot = inefficiencies below PDL
** STEP 6 — Liquidity Map
*** To refine entries:
*** Bullish day: Look below price
*** Asia sell-side
*** London low
*** Internal sell-side
*** FVGs in discount
*** Repricing zones below 8:30
*** Bearish day: Look above price
*** Asia buy-side
*** London high
*** Internal buy-side
*** Repricing zones above 8:30
*** This tells you where Judas will strike.
** FINAL RESULT — Simple Yes/No Bias
Use this final rule:
*** ✔ If Midnight & 8:30 are both pointing the same direction → that’s the day's bias.
❌ If they conflict → expect range, choppy day, or delayed move.
EXAMPLE: TODAY (the corrected data)
Midnight = 25523
EQ = 25705
→ Midnight < EQ → Bullish
London > Midnight → Bullish confirmation
8:30 = 25685 > Midnight → NY bullish confirmation
Day bias = Bullish → target PDH 25878

* The Only 3 ICT Entry Models You Really Need
** Liquidity Sweep → Market Structure Shift (MSS)
*** (The foundation)
*** “I don’t trade without a raid on liquidity.” — ICT
*** What you look for
*** Sweep of:
*** Previous day high/low
*** Session high/low
*** Equal highs/lows
*** Immediate displacement
*** MSS on 1m–5m
*** This tells you manipulation is done.
** Fair Value Gap (FVG) Entry — at Consequent Encroachment
*** (The execution engine)
*** What it does
*** Gives precise entries
*** Tight stops, high R:R
*** How ICT enters
*** First clean FVG after MSS
*** Entry at 50% of FVG (CE)
*** Rules
*** Must be in:
**** HTF bias
**** Kill zone (London / NY)
**** Not chasing price
**** This is where ICT actually clicks buy/sell.
** Judas Swing (Time-Based Manipulation)
*** (The timing filter)
*** What it does
*** Filters bad trades
*** Explains why price lies at the open
*** When
*** London Open
*** NY Open (especially 9:30–10:00)
*** What it looks like
*** Fast move against true daily bias
*** Liquidity raid
*** Sharp reversal
*** This prevents you from trading the wrong direction early.
** How the 3 Work Together (Real ICT Flow)
** Judas Swing creates manipulation
** Liquidity is swept
** MSS confirms direction
** Enter on FVG (CE)
** Target opposing liquidity
*** Why These 3 Beat the Other 9
*** Model	Why Not Needed Daily
**** OB / Breaker / Mitigation	Just locations for FVG
**** OTE	Optional confluence
**** Silver Bullet	Just a time window
**** Turtle Soup	Special case
* Your Final 3-Part ICT Trading Model
** TIME → Silver Bullet (WHEN)
*** This is your clock — nothing else.
*** NY Silver Bullet
*** 10:00 – 11:00 NY time
Ignore everything outside this window
*** Why ICT uses it:
*** Institutions deliver price during this hour.
** REASON → Liquidity + Market Structure Shift (WHY)
*** This gives you permission to trade.
*** You ONLY trade if:
*** Price takes liquidity:
*** PDH / PDL
*** Session high / low
*** Equal highs / lows
*** AND you see displacement
*** AND a Market Structure Shift on 1m–5m
*** No liquidity raid = no trade.
** ENTRY → Fair Value Gap (HOW)
*** This is the execution.
*** Mark the first clean FVG after MSS
*** Enter at 50% (Consequent Encroachment)
*** Stop:
*** Above/below the displacement high/low
*** Target:
*** Opposing liquidity
*** EQ → PDH/PDL
** Where OTE & Order Block Fit (Correctly)
*** They are filters, not requirements.
*** Order Block
*** If FVG overlaps an OB → higher probability
*** If not → trade is still valid
*** OTE (62–79%)
*** If FVG CE sits inside OTE → even better
*** If not → ignore Fibonacci
** One-Page Daily Checklist (Use This)
Before clicking buy/sell, ask:
*** Am I in Silver Bullet time?
*** Has liquidity been taken?
*** Did I see displacement + MSS?
*** Is there a clean FVG?
*** Is entry in premium/discount?
*** Is my target clear liquidity?
*** If any answer is NO → you do nothing.
*** What You Stop Doing From Now On
❌ Chasing OBs
❌ Forcing OTE
❌ Trading random FVGs
❌ Trading outside time windows
*** Final Truth (ICT Style)
* No-trade filter
“The market only moves to seek liquidity.
Your job is to enter after it’s taken.”
This model alone is enough for mastery.
** Phase 1: Market Narrative (The Context)
***  [ ] Premium/Discount Check: Is price Above Yesterday’s EQ (25041)?
**** If Yes: Bearish Framework (Look for Sells).
**** If No: Bullish Framework (Look for Buys).
*** [ ] Midnight Open Rule: Is price Above 00:00 EST (25100)?
**** If Yes: Deep Premium (Wait for a "Judas Swing" or Reversal).
**** If No: Deep Discount (Wait for Buy Setup).
*** [ ] ADR Check: Has London already moved 80% of the Average Daily Range?
**** STAND-DOWN: If yes, NY is likely a slow grind or reversal; low probability.
** Phase 2: Pre-NY Validation (The Setup)
*** [ ] Asia Range Displacement: Was the Asia range broken with a clean body close and displacement?
**** STAND-DOWN: Still inside Asia range or only "wicking" the boundaries.
*** [ ] Liquidity Sweep Check: Has only ONE side of liquidity been taken (Yesterday's High or Low)?
**** STAND-DOWN: Both sides were swept before 9:30 AM (Seek & Destroy Day).
** Phase 3: NY Execution (9:30 AM – 10:10 AM EST)
*** [ ] 8:30 AM News Reaction: Did the news create a "spike and fail" (Judas) or "spike and hold" (Trend)?
*** [ ] SMT Divergence: Is USTECH (NQ) making a Higher High while S&P 500 (ES) is making a Lower High?
Crucial for Bearish Bias confirmation.
*** [ ] The 10:00 AM Rule: Has a Market Structure Shift (MSS) + Displacement FVG formed by 10:00 AM?
**** STAND-DOWN: No clear displacement by the 9:50–10:10 AM Macro window.
** Phase 4: The Entry & Risk Kill-Switches
*** [ ] FVG Respect Test: Does price tap the FVG and show immediate rejection?
**** STAND-DOWN: Price "slices" through the FVG or creates multiple overlapping FVGs.
*** [ ] $1M Account Filter: Would I risk $2,500 on this setup if I had a $1M account?
**** If "No" (feels like a gamble): Close the chart.
* ADR Formula:
** 5-day ADR = (D1 range + D2 range + D3 range + D4 range + D5 range) ÷ 5
** (Current Day Range ÷ ADR) × 100
Example:
280 ÷ 220 = 1.27 → 127%
* In the ICT methodology, being "married" to a bias is the fastest way to lose. Here is how to mechanically shift your brain from "What I want" to "What I see."
** The "Opposite Thesis" Rule
*** Before every trade, you must argue against yourself.
*** The Action: If you are looking for a Buy, you must find at least 3 reasons why someone would Short the market right now.
*** The Logic: If you see a Bearish FVG, a Break of Structure (BOS) to the downside, or price failing to reach an old high, you cannot ignore those. If the "Short Case" looks stronger than your "Long Case," you must step away.
** Trust the "Draw on Liquidity" (DOL)
*** Bias isn't a feeling; it’s a destination. If the market is moving down, it is likely heading toward a Draw on Liquidity (an old low or an unfilled FVG below).
*** Correction: Stop asking "Is it bullish?" Ask "Where is the market going to get its next 'sip' of liquidity?"
*** If the nearest "pool" of money is below the current price (Sell-side Liquidity), the market wants to go down, regardless of how much you want it to go up.
** The "Institutional Pivot" Checklist
*** Use a physical or digital checklist. If these points aren't met, you cannot enter a long trade:
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS): Did price actually break a recent High with a strong displacement candle? (If not, it’s still bearish).
*** PD Array Alignment: Is price in a "Discount" zone (below the 50% level of the recent range)? Buying in "Premium" (the top 50%) is a trap.
*** Midnight Open Test: If price is trading below the Midnight Open, the algorithm is in a "Sell Program." You should not be looking for longs until price reclaims that level.
** Psychological "Reset" Technique
*** When you feel yourself getting "attached" to a bullish idea:
*** Step Away: Close your charts for 5 minutes.
*** Inversion: When you come back, invert your scale (Alt + I on TradingView). Look at the chart upside down. If the "downward" move now looks like a perfect "upward" trend, you are clearly in a bearish market and your bullish bias was wrong.
** Summary Table
*** Old habit - "I think it's gone down too far, it must bounce."
*** New habit -"Price is seeking Sell-side Liquidity; I will wait for a sweep."
*** Old habit- "I missed the move up, I'll buy the next green candle."
*** New habit- "Price is in Premium; I will wait for a return to a Discount FVG."
*** Old habit- "The news was good, it has to go up."
*** New habit- "Price is reacting to the news by raiding liquidity; I will follow the tape."

* 10 principles for managing and growing small accounts:
** Focus on "The Draw on Liquidity"
Before entering any trade, you must identify where the market is going next. A small account cannot afford to "guess" or sit through long drawdowns. You should only trade when there is a clear target, such as Previous Day High/Low or a Fair Value Gap (FVG).
** Trade Only During "Kill Zones"
Volatility is your friend when your margin is tight, but only if it’s predictable. ICT mandates trading only during specific windows:
London Kill Zone: 2:00 AM – 5:00 AM EST
New York Kill Zone: 7:00 AM – 10:00 AM EST If the setup happens outside these times, you ignore it.
** One Setup, One Move (Selectivity)
Small account traders often overtrade to "speed up" growth. ICT teaches that you only need one high-probability setup per week. If you hit your target for the week, you stop. Forcing trades leads to the "death by a thousand cuts."
** Use "Higher Timeframe" (HTF) Context
Never trade a 1-minute or 5-minute chart in isolation. A small account survival strategy requires you to identify the trend on the Daily or 4-Hour chart first. You only look for lower timeframe entries that align with that HTF bias.
** Risk No More Than 1% Per Trade
On a small account (e.g., $1,000), a 1% risk is only $10. Many beginners find this "boring" and risk 5–10% to make money faster. ICT warns that this is the fastest way to blow the account. You must survive long enough for the power of compounding to kick in.
** Pay Yourself (Partial Profits)
When a trade moves in your favor, take partial profits at the first liquidity level. For a small account, seeing the balance grow—even by a tiny amount—is crucial for psychological stability.
** Move to Break Even Quickly
Once the price reaches a "logical" point (like a 1:1 risk-to-reward ratio or the first internal liquidity grab), move your stop loss to the entry price. Your primary goal is to remove the risk of a losing trade as soon as possible.
** Master the "Optimal Trade Entry" (OTE)
For small accounts, entry precision is everything. ICT’s OTE (typically the 62% to 79% Fibonacci retracement level) allows for the tightest possible stop loss, which maximizes your potential reward-to-risk ratio.
** Avoid the "Lotto" Mentality
Do not trade high-impact news (like NFP or CPI) with a small account. The slippage and extreme volatility can bypass your stop loss and wipe out a small balance in seconds. Wait for the "post-news" displacement to trade.
** Process Over Profits
The goal of a small account isn't to buy a Lamborghini; it is to prove you can follow a system. If you can grow a $1,000 account to $2,000 by following the rules, you have the skill to manage $100,000. Focus on the execution, not the dollar amount.

* 10 principles organized for Survival, Motion, and Direction framework:
** Phase A: Survival (Protecting the Capital)
This phase is about staying in the game long enough to learn.
*** Treat every dollar as the last: If you lose a dollar on a $500 account, it’s much harder to replace than on a $50,000 account. Protect your "seed" capital at all costs.
*** Stop trying to get rich this week: Small accounts tempt you to use high leverage to "flip" the account. This is gambling, not trading.
*** Never trade without peace of mind: If you are trading to pay rent or out of anger (revenge trading), your "Logic Center" is offline. ICT often says, "If you're worried about the money, you've already lost."
** Phase B: Motion (Developing the Habit)
This phase focuses on the mechanics of professional behavior.
*** Only take the clearest opportunities: You don't need to catch every move. You only need the "Silver Bullet" or the "Bread and Butter" setups that scream at you from the screen.
*** Keep a journal: You cannot fix what you do not measure. A journal proves to you that your edge works, which builds the confidence needed to scale later.
*** Celebrate small gains: In a small account, a $10 profit might feel insignificant, but it is a percentage victory. Celebrate the discipline it took to get that green trade.
** Phase C: Direction (Long-Term Mastery)
This phase ensures you don't burn out and stay focused on the "Why."
*** Build a routine (Trade then Leave): Set your "Kill Zone" hours. Once they are over, close the laptop. Staring at the charts all day leads to "ghost patterns" and overtrading.
*** Find a small circle of support: Trading is lonely. Find a few like-minded students of the ICT mentorship to bounce ideas off of, but avoid "signal groups" that cloud your judgment.
*** Focus on small weekly progress: If you grow your account by just 2% a week, the math of compounding becomes a weapon. You aren't looking for a "home run"; you're looking for "base hits."
*** Remember why you started: When you hit a losing streak (and you will), reconnecting with your original goal—whether it's freedom, family, or a new career—will provide the grit to keep studying.
* Event Horizon
The Event Horizon is a high-level ICT concept (revealed in his 2024 mentorship) that acts as an "algorithmic boundary" between two Opening Gaps (NWOG or NDOG).
While you've been using gaps as targets, the Event Horizon tells you how much space the algorithm is "allowed" to play in before it must commit to a direction.

** How to Draw the Event Horizon
To find the Event Horizon, you need two Opening Gaps (e.g., this week's NWOG and last week's NWOG).
The Boundaries: Use the Low of the upper gap and the High of the lower gap.
The Grid: Use a Fibonacci tool or a "Quadrant" tool to mark the 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% levels of that specific space [02:53].
The Midpoint: The 50% level (Consequent Encroachment) of this range is the actual "Event Horizon" [03:34].
** Why it Solves Your "Daily Bias" Problem
The market views this midpoint as a "point of no return." Instead of waiting for a complex Market Structure Shift (MSS) on the 4H or Daily, you watch how the candle bodies interact with this Event Horizon:
Consolidation Zone: As long as price is bouncing between the 25% and 75% quadrants, the market is in "Accumulation." It is not yet trending [03:13].
The Commit (The Bias): If a 4H or Daily candle closes beyond the 50% midpoint with displacement, the "Event Horizon" has been crossed. The algorithm is now committed to reaching the Opening Gap on the other side [04:47].
The Support/Resistance: Once the price crosses the Event Horizon and moves toward the next gap, the 50% level often flips and acts as a "hard floor" or "hard ceiling" for any pullbacks [05:22].
** Application to your USTECH Example
You noticed USTECH was bullish after a pinbar. If you had the Event Horizon drawn between two NWOGs:
You would see the pinbar "sweep" the lower boundary.
The moment your impulsive 4H candle closed above the midpoint (50%) of that Event Horizon range, you had a confirmed Institutional Bias to the upside [09:35].
You wouldn't need to wait for the 25,779 level; the "Event Horizon" would have told you the path was clear much earlier.
** Defining the "PD Array Corridor"
Think of any two significant PD arrays on your 4H or Daily chart—for example, a Bearish Order Block above and a Bullish Fair Value Gap (FVG) below.
The space between these two arrays is the Corridor.
Upper Bound: The bottom (Mean Threshold or Open) of the Premium PD Array.
Lower Bound: The top (Consequent Encroachment or High) of the Discount PD Array.
** Finding the Event Horizon (The 50% Rule)
The Event Horizon is the 50% midpoint of the empty space between those two arrays.
The Equilibrium: As long as price stays near this 50% midpoint, it is in "True Equilibrium." The algorithm is undecided.
The Gravitational Pull: Once price closes with displacement past the 50% level toward one of the arrays, it has crossed the "Event Horizon."
The Result: The algorithm is now "locked in" to hit that specific PD Array. At this point, lower timeframe Market Structure Shifts become 10-out-of-10 setups because the higher-timeframe "draw" is confirmed.
** Why this helps your 4H/Daily Analysis
You mentioned having trouble seeing shifts on the 4H and Daily. Using the Event Horizon between PD Arrays solves this because:
It Filters Fakes: A "shift" that doesn't cross the Event Horizon is often just a fake-out or a "Seek and Destroy" profile.
It Defines "No Trade" Zones: If price is stuck in the middle (the 50% area), you stay on your hands.
It Confirms Strength: If price crosses the Event Horizon and then retests it as support/resistance, you have the ultimate confirmation of institutional sponsorship.
** The Midpoint Hierarchy: Why they are all "Event Horizons"
In the algorithm, the 50% level represents the Point of No Return. Think of it as a physical boundary:
*** Mean Threshold (Order Blocks): The "Event Horizon" of institutional commitment. If price crosses 50% of the candle body, the "gravity" of that block has failed, and price is likely sucked toward the next liquidity pool.
*** Consequent Encroachment (FVGs/Wicks): The "Event Horizon" of rebalancing. If price passes the 50% mark of an imbalance, it’s no longer just "dipping" into the gap; it is likely going to "fill" or "invert" it.
*** Equilibrium (Ranges): The "Event Horizon" of the Dealing Range. Crossing this determines whether the algorithm is in a Buy Program or a Sell Program.
** The Geometry of the "Quadrant Event Horizon"
When you measure the distance between two NWOGs (from the Consequent Encroachment of one to the CE of the other), you divide that space into four equal parts: 25%, 50% (Event Horizon), and 75%.
*** 0% (Origin)	The Launchpad (NWOG #1)	The point of initial rejection or departure.
*** 25% Level	The Escape Velocity	If price reaches and holds above the 25% mark, it signals that the "gravitational pull" of the origin is weakening.
*** 50% Level	The Event Horizon	The balance point. Once closed past, the target (100%) becomes high probability.
*** 75% Level	The Terminal Velocity	Price is now "locked in" to the target. Reversals here are rare unless a news event intervenes.
*** 100% (Target)	The Destination (NWOG #2)	Total rebalancing of the inter-gap range.
** Predicting the 50% Breach via the "First Quadrant"
You don't have to wait for the 50% level to know price is going to the other side. You look at the signature of the 25% level:
*** The "Supportive" 25%: If price moves to the 25% quadrant and then retraces, but refuses to close back below the 25% line (using the candle bodies), it is "building pressure." This is like a rocket orbiting a planet—it is preparing to break the Event Horizon.
*** The "Speed" Signature: If price slices through the 25% level with a Fair Value Gap (FVG) or long-bodied candles, the algorithm is in a "hurry." This predicts a high-speed run through the 50% Event Horizon without much hesitation.
** The "75% Distribution" (The Final Confirmation)
In the Market Maker Models (MMSM/MMBM), the 75% level often acts as the "Second Stage Distribution."
*** If price hits the Event Horizon (50%) and then reaches the 75% level, and you see a Market Structure Shift on a lower timeframe at that 75% mark, it confirms that the "gravity" of the second NWOG has fully taken over.
*** At this stage, the "Event Horizon" is now behind you, acting as the new "floor" (Support) for the final push to the target.
** Summary: The Quadrant Logic
By dividing the space into 25% increments, you are essentially measuring Volumetric Commitment.
*** Price at 25%: Interest is shown.
*** Price holding 25%: Intent is confirmed.
*** Price hitting 50%: Direction is validated.
*** Price at 75%: Target is nearly guaranteed.
This allows you to take an entry at the 25% "Early Warning" level, using the 0% (Origin) as your stop loss, long before the crowd realizes the Event Horizon has been breached.
Macros as "Gravitational Slingshots"
In physics, a spacecraft uses a planet's gravity to gain speed (a slingshot). In trading, price uses a Time Macro to gain the momentum needed to punch through the 25% or 50% levels.

If price is hovering just below the 25% Quadrant and a Macro begins (e.g., the 09:50 – 10:10 AM NYC Macro), that window provides the "volatility injection" to push price into the next stage of the Event Horizon.

If price is hovering just below the 25% Quadrant and a Macro begins (e.g., the 09:50 – 10:10 AM NYC Macro), that window provides the "volatility injection" to push price into the next stage of the Event Horizon.
*** 08:50 – 09:10 AM	The Pre-Market Open	Often used to set the 0% Origin (the Launchpad).
*** 09:50 – 10:10 AM	The Silver Bullet / Opening Macro	Pushes price through the 25% level toward the 50% Event Horizon.
*** 10:50 – 11:10 AM	The London Close Prep	Often handles the "Crossing" of the Event Horizon.
*** 11:50 – 12:10 PM	The London Close	Can act as the final push to the 75% level or the 100% Target.
** Predicting the Breach: The "Macro-Quadrants" Sync
You can predict if a level will hold or break by watching when price arrives at a Quadrant:
*** Arrival Before the Macro: If price reaches the 25% Quadrant before a Macro starts, it will often stall or "park" there. It is waiting for the "Time Fuel."
*** Arrival During the Macro: If the Macro starts and price is at the 25% mark, look for an aggressive candle. If the Macro ends and price has closed above the 25% or 50% line, the move is "validated" by the algorithm.
*** The Failed Macro: If a Macro starts, price tries to cross the Event Horizon (50%), but fails and closes back below it by the time the Macro ends (e.g., at 10:10 AM), you have a "Gravity Reversal." Price will likely fall back to the 0% Origin.
** The "20-Minute" Energy Burst
Most ICT Macros are 20 minutes long. This is the exact amount of time the algorithm typically needs to move price from one Quadrant to the next (e.g., from 25% to 50%).
*** The Golden Rule of Syncing:
**** Price at a Quadrant + Time at a Macro = High Probability Entry.
If you see price sitting at the 25% level at exactly 10:50 AM, you are looking at a high-probability "slingshot" through the Event Horizon because the algorithm is scheduled to deliver price during that window.
** Convergence: Putting it all together
Imagine this scenario:
*** Price is trading between two NWOGs.
*** Space: Price hits the 25% Quadrant (Your theory's early warning).
*** Time: The clock hits 09:50 AM (The Macro).
*** Action: The candle bodies hold the 25% level.
The Prediction: You can now confidently project that price will hit the 50% Event Horizon and likely the 100% target because both the "Map" (Quadrants) and the "Fuel" (Macro) are aligned.
** The Event Horizon Cheat Sheet (NWOG Quadrants + Macros)
Use this when price is trading between two New Week Opening Gaps (NWOGs).
*** 08:50 – 09:10The Launchpad0% - 25%Price "anchors" at the first NWOG. If it holds the 0% level, the mission to the next gap is "Go.
*** "09:50 – 10:10The Ignition25% - 50%The most violent phase. Price should punch through the 25% level and head toward the Event Horizon (50%).
*** 10:50 – 11:10The Crossing50% - 75%If price is above the Event Horizon (50%) at this time, it is officially "trapped" by the gravity of the target gap.
*** 11:50 – 12:10The Terminal75% - 100%The final rebalancing. Price completes the journey to the second NWOG.
** How to Predict the "Breach" Using This Sheet
*** Scenario A: The High-Probability Run
**** Observation: It is 10:00 AM (Ignition Macro). Price is currently sitting at the 25% Quadrant.
**** The Signal: The candle body closes above the 25% line.
**** The Prediction: You are now statistically likely to reach the Event Horizon (50%) before the next macro ends. You can enter here with a stop at the 0% level.
*** Scenario B: The Failed Orbit
**** Observation: It is 10:05 AM. Price reaches the 50% Event Horizon but begins to wick (leave long shadows) and cannot close above it.
**** The Signal: The Macro ends at 10:10 AM with price below the 50% line.
**** The Prediction: The "Gravity" of the target gap wasn't strong enough. Price will likely fall back to the 25% level or all the way to the 0% Origin to "refuel."
** Pro-Tip: The "Power of Three" Sync
To truly master this, look for these three things to happen simultaneously:
*** Price is at a Quadrant (e.g., 25% or 50%).
*** Time is inside a 20-minute Macro.
*** PD Array: There is a Fair Value Gap (FVG) or Order Block right at that quadrant line.
When these three align, you aren't just guessing; you are reading the algorithm's schedule.
* "Physics of Price" model:
** The Dark Matter: Central Bank Dealing Range (IPDA)
In physics, Dark Matter is the invisible mass that holds galaxies together; without it, they would fly apart.
*** The Trading Connection: The Central Bank Dealing Ranges (the 20, 40, and 60-day look-back periods) are the "Dark Matter" of the market.
*** You cannot see the "Dealing Range" as a single candle, but it provides the gravitational structure that dictates where every Order Block and FVG will form. It is the underlying "code" that prevents price from moving randomly.
** The Black Holes: Voids and Propulsion/Vacuum Blocks
A Black Hole is an area of such intense gravity that "normal" physics (support and resistance) ceases to exist.
*** The Trading Connection: Liquidity Voids and Vacuum/Propulsion Blocks are the Black Holes.
*** When price enters a Void, it doesn't "walk"—it "warps." There is no opposing liquidity to slow it down. Just as light cannot escape a black hole, once price enters a wide Liquidity Void after crossing an Event Horizon, it is "sucked" through that space at maximum velocity until it hits a rebalancing point.
** The Singularity: Old Highs, Lows, and Gaps
The Singularity is the point of infinite density at the center of the black hole—the ultimate destination.
*** The Trading Connection: Old Highs/Lows (Liquidity) and Old Gaps (NWOG/NDOG) are the Singularities.
*** Every move in the market is an attempt by the algorithm to reach a Singularity to "neutralize" the price. The closer price gets to an Old High (Buy Side Liquidity), the higher the "gravitational pull," which is why you see those massive, explosive "runs on stops" right at the target.
** Entanglement: Market Maker Models (Symmetry)Quantum Entanglement suggests that two particles are linked regardless of distance; what happens to one happens to the other.
*** The Trading Connection: The Market Maker Buy/Sell Models are the Entanglement of the algorithm.
*** The "Original Consolidation" on the left side of the curve is entangled with the "Distribution" on the right side. The algorithm "remembers" the price levels from the rise and mirrors them exactly on the fall. If there was a "gap" at $1.20$ on the way up, there is a mathematical requirement for that gap to be addressed or "entangled" on the way down.
** The "Unified Field" Theory of Your Model
By combining these, you’ve built a logic that explains why price behaves differently in different "zones":
*** In the Dark Matter (Dealing Range): Price is efficient and moves in "orbits" (consolidations).
*** At the Event Horizon (Inversion/50% levels): Price makes a decision to leave its current orbit.
*** In the Black Hole (Void): Price accelerates and loses all "friction."
*** At the Singularity (Target): The move ends, the energy is neutralized, and a new "Dealing Range" is established.
* The observer effect 
In the ICT framework, the "Observer Effect" is represented by Time Macros. In quantum physics, the act of observing a particle forces it to "collapse" into a single state (position or velocity). Similarly, the arrival of a specific Time Macro forces the "Dark Matter" of the Central Bank Dealing Range to reveal its hand and choose a direction.
Without the "Time" element, "Price" remains in a state of superposition (consolidation), where it could go either way.
** The Macros as the "Collapsing Function"
ICT identifies specific 20-minute windows where the algorithm is programmed to execute "short orders of instructions." These are the moments when the Event Horizon is either defended or breached.
*** 9:50 AM – 10:10 AM EST: The "Silver Bullet" window. This is the most famous macro where the algorithm seeks liquidity after the 9:30 AM equity open.
*** 10:50 AM – 11:10 AM EST: Often the "Energy Injection" that creates the final leg of the AM expansion.
*** 02:33 AM – 03:00 AM EST: The London Open macro that often sets the "Judas Swing" for the day.
** Time-Based Event Horizons
You can think of these time windows as temporal event horizons.
*** The 8:30 AM Horizon: Before 8:30 AM (News), price is often erratic. After 8:30 AM, the "Dark Energy" of the news release pushes price toward its true destination.
*** The 10:00 AM Horizon: This is the most critical for your theory. 10:00 AM is often the "Point of No Return" for the morning trend. If price is above the Midnight Open at 10:00 AM and hits a *** Reclaimed FVG, the algorithm will likely launch price into a "Black Hole" expansion that doesn't stop until 11:00 AM.
** The Unified "Quantum" Checklist
To trade this model, you look for the alignment of all your physics components:
*** Dark Matter (Bias): Is the 20/40/60-day range Bullish or Bearish?
*** The Event Horizon (Setup): Has price crossed the 50% Mean Threshold of a Breaker or an Inversion FVG?
*** The Observer Effect (Time): Is the clock hitting 9:50 AM?
*** The Black Hole (Execution): Is there a Liquidity Void between the current price and the Singularity (Old High/Low)?
** Entanglement and the "Power of Three"
The Power of Three (AMD) is the ultimate entanglement. The Accumulation (Dark Matter) is mathematically linked to the Distribution (The Singularity). You cannot have one without the other.
By using your Quadrant Theory, you are measuring the "decay" of the manipulation phase. Once the manipulation has traveled 2 standard deviations from the Midnight Open, the entanglement "snaps," and price is pulled violently toward the opposite Singularity.

* Quantum-ICT Unified Theory.
** The Origin: Mass and Potential Energy
Accumulation (The Seed): Price starts in a state of "Gravitational Collapse" (Consolidation). This range represents the Mass of the system.
The Energy Barrier: The Midnight Open (00:00 NY) acts as the primary electrical wall. Price remains in a state of superposition until it interacts with a Time Macro.
** The Ignition: Quantum Tunneling
*** The Judas Swing (Manipulation): This is the Quantum Tunneling event. Price "leaks" through the Midnight Open into a forbidden zone (Discount/Premium) to find fusion fuel (Liquidity).
*** The Fusion (MSS): When price grabs liquidity and creates a Market Structure Shift, the "Quantum State" collapses. Fusion occurs, and a new "Price Universe" is born.
** The Boundary: The Event Horizon
*** The Fair Value Gap (FVG): This is the Event Horizon. Once a candle body closes past the 50% midpoint (Consequent Encroachment) of the first FVG after an MSS, price enters a "Point of No Return."
*** Inversion (IFVG): When an old FVG is "collapsed" (sliced through), it becomes an Inversion Event Horizon, signaling that the old gravitational field has been neutralized.
** The Expansion: Dark Energy and Entanglement
*** Dark Energy: Represented by Time Macros (e.g., 10:50 AM) and News. It expands the space between price levels, driving the Distribution phase.
*** Entanglement: The "Tunnel" (Judas Swing) and the "Expansion" (Distribution) are a linked pair. Measuring the depth of the tunnel allows you to predict the height of the expansion.
** The Map: Standard Deviation Orbits
*** The Projection: Using the Fibonacci tool on the Entangled Root (00:00–00:30 range) or the Judas Tunnel:
**** -1.0 to -1.5: Breaking Orbit (Inner Planets).
**** -2.0 to -2.5: The Profit Singularity (Primary Target).
**** -4.0: The Terminal Event Horizon (Exhaustion/Supernova).
** The Law of Proportionality
*** The Spring Effect: The deeper the Tunneling (Judas) relative to the Mass (Accumulation), the higher the velocity of the move.
*** The Signature: A small accumulation followed by a deep, fast manipulation leads to a "Black Hole" expansion that rarely retests the Event Horizon.
** The Interstellar Jump: The Wormhole
*** High-Impact News: Acts as a Wormhole that rips through local space-time.
*** The Jump: Price "skips" the local solar system (15m/1H levels) and teleports directly to Macro Singularities such as Monthly Highs or All-Time Highs (ATH).
*** The Vacuum: These moves leave behind "Wormhole Gaps" (Volume Imbalances) that remain empty until the interstellar move is completed.
** The Observer Effect (The Macro)
*** The Time Windows: Gravity only "activates" during specific windows (Macros). If price hits an Event Horizon outside of a Macro, it is likely "Noise." If it hits during a Macro, the algorithm is executing its instructions.
* This MT5 Quantum Entry Checklist is designed to be followed linearly. In your physics model, you cannot reach the Singularity without first passing through the Tunnel and the Event Horizon.
** Phase 1: The Pre-Ignition (Observation)
[ ] Identify the Mass: Draw a box around the Accumulation (Consolidation) before the session opens (00:00–00:30 or 08:30–09:30 NY).
[ ] Locate the Barrier: Mark the Midnight Open price with a horizontal line. This is your "Zero-Point Gravity."
[ ] Wait for the Macro: Ensure you are within a Dark Energy window (e.g., 09:50–10:10 AM or 10:50–11:10 AM).
** Phase 2: The Ignition (The Entry Trigger)
[ ] Confirm Tunneling: Did price "tunnel" past the Midnight Open/Consolidation to sweep liquidity (The Judas Swing)?
[ ] Witness the Fusion: Look for the Market Structure Shift (MSS) on the 1m or 5m chart. This is the "Big Bang" of the new trend.
[ ] Map the Event Horizon: Identify the first Fair Value Gap (FVG) created by the MSS.
[ ] Enter the Black Hole: Place your entry at the 25% or 50% (Consequent Encroachment) of that FVG.
Physics Note: If the Proportionality Law is high (deep tunnel), enter at the 25% "Surface" because price may not reach the 50% core.
** Phase 3: The Projection (Targeting)
[ ] Calculate Entanglement: Anchor your Fibonacci tool from the Midnight Open to the Low/High of the Judas Tunnel.
[ ] Set the Singularities: * Take Profit 1: -2.0 Standard Deviation (The Primary Orbit).
Take Profit 2: -4.0 Standard Deviation (The Terminal Horizon).
[ ] Identify the Wormhole: If High-Impact News is active, ignore the -2.0 SD and look for the HTF Singularity (Old Weekly/Monthly Highs).
** Phase 4: Risk Control (Gravity Shield)
[ ] Set the Invalidation: Place your Stop Loss behind the Breaker Block or the start of the Tunneling move.
[ ] Body vs. Wick: If a candle Body closes back through the Event Horizon (the original FVG), the "Quantum State" has failed—exit the trade immediately. Wicks are allowed to "test" the horizon, but bodies must not return.
* The "Mirror" Calculation Step-by-Step
If we are looking for a Bearish reversal (because the Judas was Bullish), we follow this "Physics" math:
** Find the Origin: Mark the 00:00 Midnight Open price line. This is your "Equilibrium" (the 0 point).
** Measure the "Seed" (The Mass): Look at the consolidation before the Judas Swing (usually the 00:00–00:30 range). Measure from the Midnight Open up to the High of that small range.
*** Example: Midnight is at 1.1000. The High of the 00:00–00:30 range is 1.1010. The "Mass" is 10 pips.
** Project the Symmetry: Now, take those 10 pips and project them above that High.
*** Calculation: $1.1010 + 10 \text{ pips} = 1.1020$.
** The Result: 1.1020 is your Symmetry Point.
** Why this is "Quantum Symmetry"
Think of the Midnight Open as the Center of Gravity. The algorithm often moves in "equal chunks" of the initial range.
*** 1x the Range: The initial consolidation.
*** 2x the Range: The Judas Swing (The Tunneling).
*** The Turn: Once the Judas Swing reaches that 2x distance (the Symmetry Point), it has "exhausted" the local fuel. It has moved as far away from the center of gravity as it can without a new injection of energy.
** A Visual Correction for your Example:
*** If you are at 10:00 AM and the Judas Swing went UP (Bullish) from the Midnight Open:
*** The Goal: You are likely looking for a Short (Distribution to the downside).
*** The Search: You are looking for the "Symmetry Point" above price to find where the Bullish Judas will fail.
***  The Trap: If price passes that Symmetry Point and keeps going without a Market Structure Shift (MSS), it means the "Tunnel" has become a "Wormhole" (as we discussed) and it’s heading for a much higher HTF Singularity.
** Summary of the "Mirror" Logic
**** The Anchor: Midnight Open.
**** The Measure: Distance from Midnight Open to the Consolidation High/Low.
**** The Projection: Add that same distance to the edge of the range.
**** The "Double" Rule: Effectively, you are looking for the Judas Swing to be exactly twice the size of the initial midnight "Seed" before it reverses.
** The Nasdaq "Quantum" Specifics (09:30–10:00)
*** For Nasdaq, the 09:30 AM open is like a Supernova.
*** The Mass: Between 08:30 (when news drops) and 09:30, price usually coils.
*** The Tunnel (Judas): At exactly 09:30, Nasdaq will often "tunnel" violently in the wrong direction to hit a 15m or 1H Old High/Low.
*** The Symmetry: If that 09:30–10:00 Judas Swing is 50 points deep, you can often project a 100-point expansion (the -2.0 Standard Deviation) for the rest of the morning.
* Fractal Entanglement
If the London session creates a specific "Tunnel" and "Symmetry Point," that measurement remains a valid "Gravitational Pull" for the New York session several hours later.
** The Inter-Session Entanglement
In physics, entangled particles stay connected even when separated by distance. In trading, sessions stay connected by the Central Bank Dealing Range.
*** The London Judas (The Source): The manipulation that happens at 01:30–02:00 NY time creates a "Shadow" target.
*** The NY Open (The Reflection): When Nasdaq or Forex opens at 09:30 AM, it often "seeks" the Standard Deviation targets created by the London range, not just its own local range.
** How to Map the Fractal Targets
To see the "Big Picture" targets for the entire day, follow this protocol:
*** Measure the London "Mass" (00:00–00:30): This is your primary anchor.
*** Project the -2.0 to -4.0 Standard Deviations.
*** Observation: Often, the New York session's "Wormhole" or expansion will end exactly at the -4.0 Standard Deviation of the London Midnight Seed.
** The "Fractal Overlap" (Hyper-Confluence)
The highest probability trades occur when the Local NY Symmetry and the Macro London Entanglement land on the same price.
*** Calculation A: NY Judas Swing (09:30 AM) projects a target at 1.1050.
*** Calculation B: London Midnight Seed (00:00 AM) -4.0 SD projects a target at 1.1051.
*** The Result: You have found a Supermassive Singularity. This is where you exit 100% of your position.
** The "Entropy" of the Day
As the day moves from London to NY PM (afternoon), the "Entropy" (disorder) increases.
*** London: High order, very symmetrical.
*** NY AM: Moderate order, usually follows the London trend.
*** NY PM: High entropy. Price often "decays" back to the Equilibrium (the 50% point of the entire daily range).

** WormholeHigh-Impact NewsSkips local levels for HTF Singularities.
* Symmetry of the Manipulation (Judas) and the Total Capacity of the Algorithm (Midnight Seed).
** The Judas Swing (-2.0 SD) is the "Recoil": Like a spring being pulled back and released. If you pull it 50 units (Judas), it naturally snaps forward 100 units (-2.0). This is the Internal Balance of the move.
** The Midnight Seed (-4.0 SD) is the "Fuel Tank": It defines the total amount of energy available for the entire day. Even if there is no clear Judas Swing, the "Mass" of that 00:00–00:30 range tells you the maximum distance the "Dark Energy" can push price before the trend runs out of oxygen.
** Use the Judas -2.0 SD when you want a High-Probability Exit. Because it's based on symmetry, the algorithm almost always hits this level to balance the "fake" move.
** Use the Midnight -4.0 SD when you are in a Strong Trend (Wormhole). If price blasts through the Judas symmetry, it is being pulled by the "Macro Gravity" of the Midnight Seed toward that 4.0 level.
** The Unified View
*** The most beautiful part of this theory is that they often land on the same price. If the Judas Swing is exactly twice the size of the Midnight Seed:
**** The -2.0 SD of the Judas Swing = The -4.0 SD of the Midnight Seed.
*** When these two different measurements point to the same "Coordinate in Space-Time," you have found a Singularity. Price will stop there as if it hit a brick wall.
* Algorithmic Geometry
** The Geometry of the Midnight Seed
*** If the "Mass" (the 00:00–00:30 range) is 10 pips:
**** 1.0 SD = 10 pips.
**** 4.0 SD = 40 pips away from the range.
**** Total distance from the top of the box to the -4.0 target = 40 pips.
** The Geometry of the Judas Swing
*** Now, imagine a Standard Judas Swing. A "perfect" Judas Swing often moves twice the distance of the initial Midnight Seed to find liquidity.
*** If the Midnight Seed was 10 pips, the Judas Swing "tunnels" out of the box and travels 20 pips.
*** Now, you take your Fibonacci tool and measure that 20-pip Judas Swing as your "New Unit" (1.0).
** The Convergence (The Singularity)
*** Look what happens when we project the Judas Swing's symmetry:
**** The Judas Unit = 20 pips.
**** The -2.0 SD of the Judas = 2 x 20 pips = 40 pips.
*** The Result:
**** The -4.0 of the Midnight Seed (4 x 10) = 40 pips.
**** The -2.0 of the Judas Swing (2 x 20) = 40 pips.
***** They land on the exact same price. ---
** Why does the algorithm do this?
*** It is a Self-Validating System. The algorithm uses different "racks" of price to confirm the same destination.
*** The Midnight Seed sets the "Global" target for the day (The 40-pip limit).
*** The Judas Swing creates the "Local" energy to get there. By moving 20 pips in the wrong direction, it "loads" the spring to travel exactly 40 pips in the right direction (the -2.0 SD).
** How to use this on MT5
*** When you see the Judas Swing finish its turn and start the Distribution:
**** Draw your Fib on the Midnight Seed (00:00–00:30). Mark the -4.0.
**** Draw your Fib on the Judas Swing (the high-to-low of the manipulation). Mark the -2.0.
**** The Target: If those two lines are sitting right on top of each other, that is your "Terminal Singularity." Do not look for more profit beyond that point. The "Fuel" (Midnight Seed) and the "Recoil" (Judas Swing) have both been fully exhausted at the same time.
* Quantum ICT Unified Field Cheat Sheet
** THE GEOMETRY OF PRICE (The Double-Fib)
*** Measurement A: The Global Fuel (The Seed)
*** Anchor: Fibonacci High to Low of the Midnight Seed (00:00–00:30).
*** The Law: The algorithm is designed to expand this range by a factor of 4.
*** Target: The -4.0 Standard Deviation.
*** Measurement B: The Local Recoil (The Judas)
*** Anchor: Fibonacci High to Low of the Judas Swing (The Manipulation move).
*** The Law: A symmetrical "equal and opposite reaction" occurs at a 2:1 ratio.
*** Target: The -2.0 Standard Deviation.
** The Singularity (The "Double-Fib" Confluence)
*** Rule: When the -4.0 SD of the Seed overlaps with the -2.0 SD of the Judas, you have found a Mathematical Singularity. Price has a 90%+ probability of stopping or reversing here.
** THE PHYSICS RULES (Execution)
*** The Proportionality Law
**** Shallow Tunnel: Judas Swing is < 1.5x the size of the Mass. Target the -4.0 SD of the Judas.
**** Deep Tunnel: Judas Swing is > 2.0x the size of the Mass. Target the -2.0 SD of the Judas (Symmetry is reached faster).
*** The Event Horizon (Entry)
**** The FVG: The first Fair Value Gap after the Market Structure Shift (MSS).
**** The Entry: 25% to 50% of the FVG.
**** Invalidation: If a 1-min candle body closes back through the FVG, the "fusion" has failed.
*** The Wormhole Alert (High-Impact News)
**** The Behavior: Price ignores local Standard Deviations.
**** The Target: Look for Macro Singularities (Old Weekly Highs/Lows or All-Time Highs). Use the -4.0 SD of the Yearly range.
*** The 3-Bar Exhaustion Rule (Exit): When price enters the Singularity Zone (the overlap), watch the 1-minute chart:
**** Candle 1: Hits the target.
**** Candle 2: Small body (loss of heat).
**** Candle 3: Inside Bar or Harami.
**** ACTION: Close trade. Energy is exhausted.
* The 3 Key Rules of a Breakaway Gap:
** The Location: It appears right after a Liquidity Raid or a Market Structure Shift (MSS). It is the gap that forms when the algorithm decides to leave a price level behind forever (or for a long time).
** The Retracement Rule: If price comes back to a Breakaway Gap, it should not close more than 50% (Consequent Encroachment) into the gap. Usually, it just kisses the top/bottom and takes off.
** The "Left Open" Signature: While a normal FVG is a "to-do list" item for the algorithm to fill later, the Breakaway Gap is a "seal." If it gets filled, it is no longer a Breakaway Gap—it's just a failed FVG.
* The 4 Rules of a Propulsion Block
** The "Tested Once" Rule A Propulsion Block is not a fresh Order Block. It is an Order Block that has already been traded back into. * Scenario: Price creates a Down-close candle (Bullish OB), price rallies, then drops back down into that candle (the first test). The candle that price forms while bouncing out of that first test becomes your Propulsion Block.
** The "Aggressive Displacement" Rule The candle must lead to a sharp, impulsive move that breaks a Short-Term High/Low (MSS). This confirms that the "Smart Money" has finished their accumulation and is now "propelling" the price.
** The "Mean Threshold" Sensitivity (The Strict Rule) Similar to your rule that "no body is entertained in a Breakaway Gap," the Propulsion Block has a very strict boundary:
*** The Rule: Price should ideally only touch the Open or the Wick of the Propulsion Block.
*** The Limit: The candle bodies must not close past the Mean Threshold (50%) of the Propulsion Block. If the body closes past 50%, the "propulsion" is lost, and it’s just a regular, weak Order Block.
** The "Immediate Result" Rule A true Propulsion Block must result in an immediate expansion toward your target (like your 25,300 level). If price lingers or "hangs out" around the Propulsion Block for several candles, it is failing. It should act like a hot stove—price touches it and jumps away instantly.
* The 5 Absolute Rules of a Valid Order Block
** The "Last Opposite Candle" Rule
*** Bullish OB: The last bearish (down-close) candle before a strong move up.
*** Bearish OB: The last bullish (up-close) candle before a strong move down.
*** Note: If there are consecutive candles of the same color, the entire cluster can be treated as one Order Block.
** The "Liquidity Raid" Requirement (High Probability) A high-probability OB doesn't just form in thin air. It forms after the market has swept liquidity (previous highs/lows). The OB is the footprint of the institutions buying/selling the very liquidity that retail traders used for their stop losses.
** The "Displacement" Rule (Non-Negotiable) After the OB candle forms, price must leave that area with aggressive speed.
*** The Signal: It must create a Market Structure Shift (MSS) and leave a Fair Value Gap (FVG) immediately after the block.
*** If price grinds away slowly, it is NOT an Order Block; it’s just a consolidation.
** The "Mean Threshold" (50%) Rule This is the rule for your "body" observation:
*** Rule: The Mean Threshold is the exact 50% midpoint of the Order Block candle (from open to close, or sometimes wick to wick if the wicks are small).
*** The Strict Limit: For an OB to remain valid, the candle bodies must not close past the Mean Threshold.
*** The Outcome: If a candle body closes past the 50% level, the order flow has shifted, and the block is likely failing.
** The "Freshness" (Mitigation) Rule The first return to an Order Block is the highest probability trade. Every time price returns to the block thereafter, it "collects" more of the remaining orders, making the block weaker. By the third or fourth touch, the "wall" is gone.
* The 30–40 Pip Manipulation Filter
** According to the video and ICT core principles, the Midnight Open (00:00 NY Time) is your anchor.
*** The Rule: High-probability manipulation usually stays within 30 pips of the Midnight Open.
*** The "Stress Test" (40 Pips): If price moves beyond 40 pips away from the 00:00 Open, the algorithm is likely "spooling" (expanding) in that direction. At that point, the reversal setup becomes low probability—the market isn't "trapping," it's "leaving."
* "Entry relative to 00:00" vs. "Entry relative to Macros"
** You noted that this manipulation can be used as a setup for entry. This connects your two concepts:
*** Standard Deviation (Measure): Tells you how far the algorithm projects the move (the target).
*** 30–40 Pip Filter (Boundary): Tells you where the manipulation should end before reversing.
*** Entry Logic: If price runs 25–30 pips away from 00:00 into a Higher Timeframe (HTF) level (like a 15m Fair Value Gap or Order Block) during the 2:00 AM or 8:30 AM window, that is your Optimal Trade Entry (OTE).
* What is the 9:30 Opening Range Gap (ORG)?
** Definition: It is the price difference between the closing price of the regular session (4:00 PM the previous day) and the 9:30 AM opening price today [00:43].
** The Function: This gap acts as a "magnetic zone."
** If 9:30 opens with a gap, the algorithm often retraces to fill that gap (partially or fully) before making the "real" move of the day [04:43].
** The 30-40 Pip Rule Connection: If this retracement back to the ORG stays within the 30-40 pip range of the Midnight Open, it is a high-probability "Institutional Rebalance" [04:58].
* Confirming the Trend: The 9:30 Setup
** ICT explains that the ORG helps you distinguish between High Resistance and Low Resistance liquidity:
** The Fake-Out (Manipulation): If price drops at 9:30 into the ORG and hits a Fair Value Gap (FVG) or Order Block within that gap, it is likely just cleaning up the "Opening Range" [04:15].
** The Confirmation: Once the gap is tested (even if only 1/4 of it is filled), look for a Market Structure Shift (MSS) with displacement away from the gap [05:21].
** The Trend: If the DXY (Dollar Index) fails to make a new high while the index is filling its ORG, this SMT Divergence confirms that the 9:30 move is a real expansion toward your targets (like your 25,693) [05:53].
* Using the 30-40 Pip Boundary with the ORG
** You can use the 40-pip filter to "stress test" the 9:30 open:
** If 9:30 stays within 40 pips of Midnight: The ORG fill is a high-probability "Buy/Sell" setup. You can enter as price leaves the gap.
** If 9:30 runs 40+ pips away from Midnight WITHOUT filling the ORG: This is a Runaway Gap. It means the market has so much momentum it doesn't need to rebalance. In this case, do not wait for a retracement—the "Shortest Path" to liquidity is already in play.
* The Weekly Equilibrium (EQ) Filter
** Purpose: To define the "Institutional Fair Value" for the week and identify high-probability reversal zones.
** Definition: The 50% mark of the Previous Week's Range (High to Low).
** The 50% Rule: * Premium (Above EQ): Market is "expensive." Look for Sell-Side targets or wait for a retracement.
** Discount (Below EQ): Market is "cheap." Look for Buy-Side setups (The "Gift").
** The "Magnet" Effect: In a trending week, the market often returns to the Weekly EQ to pick up orders before expanding.
** The Failure Swing: If the price reverses before hitting the Weekly EQ (like your 25,222 bounce), it signals extreme strength in the current trend direction.
* The Average Daily Range (ADR) Filter
** Purpose: To measure the "Fuel Tank" and avoid trading into exhaustion.
** The Calculation: Sum the distance of the last 5 Daily Ranges (High minus Low) and divide by 5.
** The 30% Rule: If the market uses less than 30% of its ADR by the session open, expect a Large Expansion (Trending Day).
** The 80%–100% Rule: If the market has already moved nearly 100% of its ADR before the 9:30 AM or 1:30 PM windows, it is Exhausted.
** Action: Do not chase breakouts. Look for mean reversion back to Equilibrium.
** The News Multiplier: * No News: Respect the 100% ADR limit strictly.
** High-Impact News: Price can stretch to 125%–150% of the ADR.
* The Integrated "Institutional" Strategy
** How to combine them for the 9:30 AM Open:
** Locate the "Gift": If your bias is Bullish and price is moving below the Midnight Open, check its distance to the Weekly EQ.
** Measure the Tank: Check how many points of the ADR have been used during this downward move.
** Identify the Reversal Zone: * If the move is 190 points down (50% of ADR) and it hits a HTF Level (like your 25,222 floor) just above the Weekly EQ, the "trap" is complete.
** Confirm the Shift: Wait for MSS + Displacement (The 306-point rally signature).
** Set the Target: Your target should be the un-swept Session Highs or the opposite end of the ADR.
* Summary Note for your Tape Reading
*** "I use the Weekly EQ to tell me WHERE to buy, and the ADR to tell me HOW MUCH room the market has left to move. If the market is at a Discount (Price) and the tank is full (ADR), I have a high-probability trade."
* How to Calculate the Weekly Averages
** To calculate these, you don't look at the single highest or lowest candle. Instead, you average the daily peaks and troughs:
** Average Weekly High: Sum of all 5 Daily Highs $\div$ 5.
** Average Weekly Low: Sum of all 5 Daily Lows $\div$ 5.
* Weekly Averages for knowing Overbought and oversold levels
** Why is this important for Session Trading?
** This creates a "Value Zone" that is much more accurate than just a single price line.
** The "True" Premium/Discount: In a bullish week, the Average Weekly High (25,503.2) acts as a "Value Ceiling." If price is trading above this average, it is considered "Overbought" on a weekly basis, even if it hasn't reached the absolute high (25,728) yet.
** The Re-balancing Magnet: When price is trending, it rarely returns to the absolute Weekly Low (24,903). Instead, it often drops to the Average Weekly Low (25,152) to find support.
* The "Value Bracket" (Institutional RSI)
** Think of these levels as a rubber band:
*** Overbought (The Average High: 25,503): When price is trading above this level, the "rubber band" is stretched to the upside. Any 9:30 AM move that continues higher is considered high-risk because the market is already in a Weekly Premium.
*** Oversold (The Average Low: 25,152): When price is trading below this level, the rubber band is stretched to the downside. This is the Weekly Discount. This is where you look for those 300-point "snap-back" rallies.
* Two layered approach
** In the ICT methodology, you do not use a single, static number all week. Instead, you use a two-layered approach: one part stays fixed to give you "Long-term Narrative," and the other part updates daily to give you "Intraday Precision."
** The Weekly EQ: Keep it FIXED
** You should stick to the 25,315.5 level (your previous week's EQ) throughout the entire upcoming week.
*** Why? The algorithm uses the previous week’s range as the "Anchor." Institutions have their stop-losses and pending orders parked relative to last week's highs and lows.
*** The Logic: If you change your Weekly EQ every day by adding Monday's data, you lose sight of where the original "Institutional Discount" was. Think of last week's EQ as your "Compass"—it doesn't move just because you took a few steps.
* The ADR: Use a ROLLING 5-Day Average
** Unlike the EQ, your ADR should update every day.
*** Why? ADR measures Volatility, which is like the "weather." If Monday has a massive 600-point range, the "Average" volatility has increased. You need to know this so you don't set your Take Profit too small on Tuesday.
*** The Calculation for Tuesday: 1. Drop the oldest day (last week's Monday). 2. Add the newest day (this week's Monday). 3. Recalculate the sum and divide by 5.
* The "Mid-Week Shift" (Wednesday/Thursday)
** By the time you reach Wednesday or Thursday, you should add one more level to your chart: the Current Week's EQ.
** Monday-Tuesday: Use only the Previous Week's EQ.
** Wednesday-Friday: Mark the 50% level of the current week's High and Low.
** If the market is bullish, it will often "retrace" to the Current Week's EQ on Wednesday or Thursday before one final expansion into Friday. This is known as the London/NY Mid-Week Reversal.
* Checklist
** MondayPrevious- 5 DaysPrevious Week's- EQ Only
** TuesdayRolling (Drop last Mon, add this Mon)-Previous Week's EQ (The Anchor)
** WednesdayRolling (Drop last Tue, add this Tue) Anchor EQ + Current Week's Midpoint
** ThursdayRolling (Drop last Wed, add this Wed)Anchor EQ + Current Week's Midpoint
* The "Pro" Tape Reading Rule:
*** "Use Previous Week's Levels to find the Direction (The Why). Use the Rolling ADR to find the Distance (The How Far)."
*** If you keep updating your EQ daily, you will find yourself "chasing the price" and potentially buying at a local high that is actually a Weekly Premium. Stay anchored to that 25,315.5 level—it is your safety net.
* ADR-ICT: The Mathematical Breakdown
** Think of the ADR (351.2) as the total length of a ruler. The Daily Open is the center point of that ruler.
** ADR High: This is the "Expected Ceiling." If the market moves 175.6 points (half of 351.2) above the open, it has used up its "normal" upward energy.
** ADR Low: This is the "Expected Floor." If the market moves 175.6 points below the open, it has used up its "normal" downward energy.
*** The Formula Example (using your ADR of 351.2):
**** Let’s assume Monday’s Midnight Open is 25,700.
**** Step 1: Divide ADR by 2 $\rightarrow 351.2 /
**** 2 = 175.6$Step 2 (High): $25,700 + 175.6 = \mathbf{25,875.6}$Step
**** 3 (Low): $25,700 - 175.6 = \mathbf{25,524.4}$
** How to use this for the "9:30 AM Gift"
*** This is where it gets interesting for your tape reading. Remember that 190-point drop you saw on Friday?
*** If the market drops below the ADR Low during the London session or right at the 9:30 AM Open, it is "Statistically Overextended."
**** * The Trap: Retail traders see the 190-point drop and think, "The market is crashing! I should sell!"
**** The ICT Logic: You look at your chart and see the price is at 25,524.4 (ADR Low). You know the market has already moved its "fair share" for the day.
**** The Trade: Instead of selling, you wait for the stuttering/consolidation and the MSS. You are buying at a "Deep Discount" that is mathematically backed by the 5-day average.
* The ADR (351.2) is a Ruler. It only cares about the distance between the lowest point of the day and the highest point of the day.
** Breaking Down your ExampleLet's look at the math of your Friday scenario:
*** The Start: Price opens at 25,600 (Hypothetically).The Drop (Manipulation): Price moves down 190 points to 25,410. (This is now your Daily Low).
*** The Rally (Expansion): Price moves up 304 points from that low of 25,410.The Finish: Price ends at 25,714. (This is now your Daily High).
*** The Calculation of the Range:
**** Daily High (25,714) - Daily Low (25,410)} = 304 points
*** The Result: Even though the price "moved" a total of 494 points (190 down + 304 up), the Daily Range is only 304 points.Since 304 is less than your ADR of 351.2, the algorithm stayed perfectly within its "allotted fuel" for the day.
* ICT's ADR and the Rolling ADR: The Hybrid Solution (How to actually trade tomorrow)
** Use the ICT Style to find your Direction, and use the Rolling ADR to find your Exit.
** Step-by-Step for Monday:
*** Direction (ICT): Look at your Weekly EQ (25,315.5). If price is above it and moving toward the Weekly High (25,728), your direction is BULLISH.
*** The Entry (ICT): Wait for the 9:30 AM Manipulation (The "Gift"). Look for a drop into a 15m Fair Value Gap or a sweep of a session low.
*** The Target (Rolling ADR): Once you are in the trade, look at your ADR (351.2).
*** If your ICT target (the Weekly High) is 200 points away, and the market has only moved 100 points so far today, the ADR says: "Go for it, there's plenty of fuel left."
*** If your target is 500 points away, but the ADR is only 351, the ADR says: "Be careful. The market might stall before reaching your target. Take partial profits at 350 points."
* Overbought and oversold issues
** The Weekly Boundaries (The "Macro" Overbought)
*** When I said "Price above Weekly High is Overbought," I was talking about the Trend.
*** Scale: The entire 5-day week.
*** Logic: If price is above last week's average high, it is "expensive" for the week.
*** Analogy: Buying a house in a neighborhood where prices just hit an all-time high. It might keep going up, but you are paying a "Premium."
** The ADR/2 Boundaries (The "Micro" Overbought)
*** The ADR/2 formula is for Intraday Overbought.
*** Scale: Just today (The 24-hour cycle).
*** Logic: Even in a very strong weekly trend, the market can only move so many points in a single day before it needs to "breathe."
*** Analogy: A world-class marathon runner (the market) can run 26 miles (the Weekly Trend), but they can't sprint at 20mph for the whole trip. If they sprint for 2 miles (ADR/2), they have to slow down to a walk (Retracement) even if they haven't reached the finish line yet.

* ICT Reversal Signatures: The 5 Institutional Styles
** 1. The Rejection Wick (The Liquidity Grab)
*** Visual: A long wick that pierces a key liquidity level (PDH/PDL) but results in a fast, aggressive snap-back.
*** Logic: The "Stop Run" is completed instantly. The wick does the work of collecting money, and the body stays far away from the level.
*** Entry: Look for a Market Structure Shift (MSS) on the 1m chart immediately after the wick forms.
** 2. The Big Pair (Large Range Displacement Reversal)
*** Visual: A massive Red candle immediately followed by an equal or larger Green candle (or vice versa).
*** Logic: Instantaneous Rebalance. The algorithm switches from Sell-side to Buy-side delivery so fast that no Fair Value Gap (FVG) is left behind.
*** Entry: Focus on the Mean Threshold (50%) of the candle pair or a Change in State of Delivery (CISD).
** 3. The Breaker Block (The Failed Support/Resistance)
*** Visual: Price makes a High (1), drops to a Low (2), rallies to a Higher High (3), then crashes through the Low (2).
*** Logic: The "Up-close" or "Down-close" candles at the Low (2) become the Breaker. The market "breaks" the support and flips it into a ceiling.
*** Entry: Sell/Buy the retest of the Breaker Zone (the failed swing point).
** 4. The Three-Drive Pattern (Staircase Exhaustion)
*** Visual: Three distinct, symmetrical "pushes" into a liquidity zone (High, Higher High, Final Higher High).
*** Logic: Used to engineer liquidity. Each drive traps more "counter-trend" traders. It is the "Last Gasp" of a trend before a major reversal.
*** Entry: Look for SMT Divergence on the 3rd drive and a displacement move back through the 2nd drive’s low/high.
** 5. The Swing Failure Pattern (SFP - The Classic Reclaim)-Reclaimed FVG
*** Visual: Price trades above a previous high or below a previous low, but the body of the candle closes back inside the range.
*** Logic: Shows a lack of "Acceptance." The algorithm refuses to deliver price at that new level, signaling that the move was purely a manipulation.
*** Entry: Confirmed when the next candle creates a CISD (closing above/below the previous candle's open).
