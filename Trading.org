* PD Array
** Bearish Pd Array Matrix
=> Old High or low
=> Rejection block
=> Bearish order block
=> Fair value gap
=> Liquidity void
=> Bearish breaker block
=> Bearish mitigation block
** Buullish Pd Array Matrix
=> Bullish mitigation block
=> Bullish breaker
=> Liquidity void
=> Fair value gap
=> Bullish order block
=> Rejection block
=> Old low or high
** Intraweek Market Reversals
=> If price action moves faster than the last days of a week on Monday and Tuesday, it is going to meet price delivery and then reverses soon. Do not think that the speed of market movement as an opportunity to continue in the same bias.
=> On Wednesday and Thursday there is monthly reversal always.
* Internal range liquidity and market structure shift (2022, episode 3)
=> If the buystops of old highs are taken, market structure shift occurs;
=> If the buystops of old lows are taken, market structure shift occurs;
=> If market structure occurs, order blocks of higher highs and higher lows or lower highs and loser lows will be violated;
=> Order blocks are change in a state of price delivery, hence they go in line with market structure shaft.
* Intraday Order Flow and Understanding the Daily Range (2022, episode 5 for indices)
=> S&P 500 E-Mini (Sep,Dec,Marc, June), daily range = 8:30-12:00 Am and 13:00-16:30 pm, (Lunch time do not trade 12:00-13:00)
* Market structure: Long term high/low, Intermediate term high/low and short term high/low
=> Long term high/low is a framework it is at high time frame
=> Intermediate term high/low balances FVG of LTH/LTL
=> Intermediate term high/low are two types:
        => The one which has Short term high/low below to the right and left; this one shows the market is strong
        => The one which has Short term/low above to the right and left; this one shows the market so weak.
        => Short term high/lows are order blocks which are failed or resisted
* Institutional order flow

** The Core Idea

*** IOF = the direction institutions are delivering price.

*** It’s read by watching how price reacts around imbalances and opposite-color candles.

*** If price respects those “institutional footprints,” order flow is intact.

*** If those structures break, the order flow is violated → don’t trade.

** Bearish Institutional Order Flow

*** In a bearish environment:

**** Market leaves imbalances (FVGs) to the downside.

**** When price retraces to rebalance those imbalances, the highs formed during that retrace should not be broken higher.

**** All up-close candles in the swing act as resistance order blocks.

**** If price trades above those up-close candles, IOF is broken → bias is invalid.

**  Bullish Institutional Order Flow

*** In a bullish environment:

**** Market leaves imbalances (FVGs) to the upside.

**** Price retraces into the imbalance and should respect the down-close candles (bullish OBs).

**** These down-close candles act as support structures.

**** If price cuts below these candles, it invalidates the order flow unless there’s a nearby swing low that must be cleared first (a sell-side liquidity raid).

**  Special Note on Down-Close Candles in Bullish Moves

*** In bullish swings, most candles will close up.

*** The few down-close candles become very important.

*** They should act as support when price retraces.

*** If they are overlapped and broken, the bullish IOF is no longer clean.

** Liquidity Exception

*** If a down-close candle is violated only because price is taking a nearby swing low (sell-side liquidity), that’s still consistent with bullish IOF.

*** After the liquidity grab, price can re-accumulate and continue higher.

** Trading Rule

*** Respect IOF structure.

*** If the opposite-color candles (order blocks) are violated improperly, do not trade.

*** Wait for a new, well-formed setup aligned with clean IOF.

** Summary in Plain Words

*** Bearish IOF → up-close candles = resistance. Their highs shouldn’t be broken.

*** Bullish IOF → down-close candles = support. Their lows shouldn’t be broken.

*** If they are broken without a liquidity reason, IOF is invalid → sit out.

* ICT Setup Model (2022 Mentorship)
** Time & Anchor Points

*** Midnight Open (00:00 EST/NY time) → reference anchor.

*** 8:30 AM Open (EST/NY time) → reference anchor.

*** Compare these two opens:

**** Bullish bias: Midnight open above 8:30 open → market is in discount → good for buys.

**** Bearish bias: Midnight open below 8:30 open → market is in premium → good for sells.

**** Note: This setup repeats weekly in Forex (less in bonds/indices).

** Premium / Discount Logic

*** Sell only in premium (above equilibrium).

*** Buy only in discount (below equilibrium).

*** Never flip the rule → that’s how you avoid unnecessary losses.

** Price Action Filtering

*** You need a liquidity run first:

**** Bearish case:

***** Price runs above relative equal highs (old high).

***** Then displaces lower and breaks a short-term low.

***** That’s your confirmation.

**** Bullish case:

***** Price runs below relative equal lows (old low).

***** Then displaces higher and breaks a short-term high.

***** That’s your confirmation.

***** No displacement through a short-term high/low = no valid setup.

** Execution Rule

**** Entry must be on a Fair Value Gap (FVG) in the displacement leg.

***** Stop placement:

***** Daily → Hourly → 15M → 3M → 2M → 1M.

***** There will always be an FVG at some fractal level.

** Trade Management

*** Target: levels of liquidity (equal highs, equal lows, or imbalance fills).

*** Divide the move into levels (partials can be taken at each).

*** Follow strict model → if setup breaks (order flow invalid), do not trade.

** Core Principle (Foundation)

**** A setup requires two conditions:

**** Liquidity run (above highs or below lows).

**** Displacement + break of short-term structure.

**** Once both occur, you zoom in, find the FVG, and trade.

** Quick Bias Rule (Episode 25)

*** Bearish = Old high taken → then old low taken.

*** Bullish = Old low taken → then old high taken.

** Summary in Plain Words:
*** Use the midnight and 8:30 opens to determine premium/discount. Look for liquidity raids (old highs/lows). Require displacement + short-term break to confirm bias. Enter at the FVG. Always buy in discount, sell in premium.

* ICT Counter-Trend Context Model

** Big Picture (Higher Timeframe Bias)

*** Start with the higher timeframe (Daily or 4H).

*** Confirm the market is in a long-term bearish move (downtrend).

*** A counter-trend setup = looking for short-term bullish retracement trades inside that bearish trend.

** Define the Objective (Draw on Liquidity)

*** A counter-trend trade must aim for a clear liquidity pool above current price.

**** Examples:

***** Relative equal highs.

***** A clean swing high.

***** A daily imbalance or order block.

***** If there is no higher-timeframe liquidity target, do not take a counter-trend trade.

**  Wait for Discount Retracement Zone

*** Drop into lower timeframes (1H, 15M).

*** Watch for price to retrace into a discount area of the short-term range.

*** In that discount zone, look for:

*** Fair Value Gap (FVG).

*** Market Structure Shift (MSS) → break of short-term high.

*** Down-close order block acting as support.

**  Execution Logic

*** Entry: in the FVG or OB inside the discount zone.

*** Stop loss: below the short-term low.

*** Target: the higher-timeframe liquidity (your Draw on Liquidity).

**  Patience Rule

*** If price runs impulsively to the objective (liquidity) without retracing into your discount entry zone →
*** ❌ No trade.

*** Only enter when ICT rules align.

**  Time of Day Context

*** New York Lunch (11:30 AM – 1:30 PM NY time):

*** Market often prints equal highs during this slow period.

*** In counter-trend context, price may later rally through those equal highs as it seeks the higher-timeframe liquidity.

** Summary

*** Counter-trend = trading retracements against the big bias.

*** Must have:

**** Higher-timeframe bearish context.

**** A clear liquidity target (draw on liquidity).

**** Discount zone + FVG + MSS on lower timeframe for entry.

**** Discipline to wait if no retracement forms.

**** Awareness of NY Lunch equal highs as staging areas for liquidity runs.
* When to buy
=> ICT advises "buy on Wednesday on New York session".
=> Pay attention to Accumulation, Manipulation (creating low/high of the day), distribution (expansion); that is power of AMD!
* Narrative

=> Narrative explains where the market is likely to go. It is not determined by indicators, but by analysis. Where is that draw on liquidity? It is not wise for you to determine your bet, gamble or investment on what an indicator is saying versus reading price action and getting the logic behind what it's doing. Narrative is the understanding of what price should why and what things will it encounter to prove that the narrative that you are assuming in place is in fact underway. We create a fair value gap here on 15M time frame, that is our area to watch and see if price supports a run if it digs into that and starts to repel higher/lower and we take out this short term high; that is enough to set up a stage for the afternoon/morning trend. That afternoon session move or set up or price swing that is what we are looking for now because the market failed to go to an objective we are looking for it was respecting the daily fair value gap and it rallied up and what very valuable that is. Here it took out that short term high so now we have an absolute market structure shift bullish with swing high and the market comes back down in here and re balances this fvg. Now we do not look into support resistance, we are looking at the fact that we went through this short term high created an imbalance and then we treated that into that now when we get into this area here we are interested in looking at inter market relationships. We want to study real accumulation, manipulation and distribution. How do we do that? We are going to go into the lower time frame five minute chart. I want you to go back to your 15m chart, this is where the work is required on your part. This price run from where to where, you see that. Look at your chart and shade that in on a 15m time frame. And drop down into the five minute; you will see how it drops into that shaded area. So we are working from a higher time frame 15m chart into 5m chart. This is running into that fvg. Now if you are staying on one time frame or at least not carrying over higher time frame analysis, into lower time frame, you are gonna be trading blind; you have no what you are looking for. 

=> If the market is bullish it is good opportunity to have midnight opening higher than 8:30 opening. And the market rallies high; before lunch it retraces and go down; and after lunch it rallies high again targeting previous days high.

* T.G.I.F. Setup

=> The T.G.I.F. setup in the context of ICT (Inner Circle Trader) trading stands for "Thank God It's Friday" setup.
=> Focus on Friday: The setup targets a specific movement on Friday, often referred to as "Friday profit-taking" or a weekly retracement.
=> Weekly Retracement: The core idea is that after a strong directional move throughout the week the price is expected to retrace a certain percentage back into the weekly trading range.
=> Target Levels: The retracement is often expected to move back into the 20% to 30% level of the entire weekly range.
=> Confluence with Market Structure: It's usually looked for after the market has reached a significant Higher Time Frame (HTF) objective, like a premium (overbought) or discount (oversold) level, and is often confirmed by concepts like a Judas Swing (a false move to trap traders) and a Market Structure Shift (MSS) on lower time frames.
=> Timing: The setup is often anticipated during the New York afternoon session.

* Time and Price
=> Price is delivered by an algorism; there is no buying or selling pressure.
=> Algorithmic theory is based on Time and Price.
=> Price levels are useless until time is considered.
=> Time is of no use unless price is at a key PD array.
=> Blending the two yields astonishing results & precision. 

* Key to Daily Bias
=> Every day bias is unrealistic;
=> Determine the likely weekly expansion;
=> Look for obvious liquidity in that direction;
=> Identify imbalances 
=> Focus on the high or medium calendar event dates;
=> Look for directional price runs in my kill zones intraday.
=> You do not have trade every single day, there are days when you cannot trade. 


* Algo
=> The Algo will not allow price to drop under a FVG as it tracts the buy side liquidity which has been already taken. The price action movement is not determined by supply demand or support Resistance, it is determined by Algo. 

* London session
=> The EUR & GBP pairs are ideal for this time of a day.
=> The London Open frequently setup an Optimal Trade Entry pattern that can offer a 25-50 pip scalp.
=> The Key Times to monitor are 2:00 am to 5:00 am New York time. This is the ideal ICT London Kill zone.
=> In London Open either price action drop down initially and then rallies up and it creates very high of the day. The day's low form down and it comes of a low and closes off the low (in London-New York overlap). The next trading day again in New York midnight (0:00), the price again rallies for the euro dollar up and creates the high and trades down to low the day later on and  goes consolidation and closes in the middle of the range.

The key take away is that London Open generally has the highest probability of creating the high or the low of the day. This is the biggest discovery because it helps you to determine where you are bearish the actual height of the day is going to form and if you can do that with a reasonable measure of accuracy or consistency just imagine if you could get three to four opportunities where you can get the high today and ride the majority of the daily range. If you could this for a few times a month you could do exceptionally well as an FX trader now. The same phenomenon occurs in other assets like crypto, commodities, index and bonds.
=> When the market bullish the tendency is for the market to trade down creating the low of the day in the London and open ICT kill zone. Again here market trades down after midnight (0:00) New York time creates the low of the day between 2:00 and 5:00 am New York. In this case you could have taken a long from the start and place buy stops below wicks of the low. I want you to look at the relationship between one London open low and the immediate after London open low; between the two you can find the highest high of the day. That is your trading range.
=> If London session typically creates the Low of the day when market is primarily Bullish and the High of the day when Bearish.
=> When the market is poised to trade Higher on the Daily timeframe-we can focus on the London Session to post the Low of the Trading Day. If the Daily is poised to trade Lower-we can focus on the London Session to post the High of the Trading Day. 

* ICT Price & Time Grid Cheat Sheet
** Price Action Grid (Where Liquidity Sits)

*** Old Highs → Buy stops above (liquidity).

*** Old Lows → Sell stops below (liquidity).

*** Liquidity Run → First raid is fake-out, second raid shows true direction.

*** Displacement → Strong break of structure confirms bias.

*** Order Blocks (OBs) → Last opposing candle before displacement (entry zones).

*** Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) → Imbalances where price often returns for entries.

➡ Sequence: Liquidity → Sweep → Displacement → OB / FVG → Expansion.

**  Time Grid (When Liquidity Gets Taken)

*** Daily Cycle

****  Asian Range (00:00–05:00 GMT)
Market consolidates, builds liquidity.

****  London Killzone (07:00–10:00 GMT / 02:00–05:00 EST)
Stop hunts: often takes Asia’s high/low.

****  New York AM (12:00–15:00 GMT / 07:00–10:00 EST)
Main move of the day, displacement + setups.

****  New York PM (17:00–19:00 GMT / 12:00–14:00 EST)
Reversal or continuation into close.

*** Weekly Cycle

**** Mon–Tue → Weekly high or low often forms.

**** Wed–Thu → Expansion in real direction.

**** Fri → Profit taking, reversals, consolidation.

***  How to Combine Them

**** Step 1: Mark old highs & lows (yesterday’s, weekly, Asia session).

**** Step 2: Wait for liquidity run during killzones (London & NY).

**** Step 3: Identify which liquidity gets swept first (old high or old low).

**** Step 4: Confirm with displacement in opposite direction.

**** Step 5: Enter on retrace to OB or FVG in killzone.

***  Examples

**** Bearish Day Example

**** Asia consolidates.

**** London takes Asia’s high (buy stops).

**** NY AM breaks down through Asia/London low with displacement.

**** Retrace to OB/FVG → Short.

**** Bullish Week Example

**** Monday sweeps previous week’s low.

**** Wednesday breaks up with displacement.

**** Retrace to OB/FVG → Long into Thursday.


* Criterion to determine bias
=> Nice — below is a practical, step-by-step workflow you can run on any chart to determine bias using the ICT idea that opposite-color candles become support/resistance (i.e. order blocks). Follow this exactly on your chart and you’ll get consistent, repeatable reads.

**  Pick your timeframes

*** Higher timeframe (HTF) = trend anchor (4H / Daily).

*** Lower timeframe (LTF) = entries and order-block validation (1H / 15m).
*** Always require HTF and LTF alignment: if HTF is bullish, prefer bullish setups on LTF.

**  Define the current structure (swing high / swing low)

*** Mark the most recent swing high and most recent swing low on the HTF.

*** Ask: did structure break to new highs (higher highs / higher lows) or new lows (lower lows / lower highs)? That tells you the initial directional tilt.

**  Measure candle-color dominance (quick bias heuristic)

*** On the swing (from swing low → swing high or vice versa), count the closes of the candles:

*** If majority are up-close candles (close > open) → bullish tilt.

*** If majority are down-close candles (close < open) → bearish tilt.

*** Give extra weight if those same-direction candles have bigger bodies and break structure (displacement).

*** Rule of thumb: majority over the last 8–12 candles in the swing; if 60%+ same color and structure is in that direction, bias leans that way.

**  Identify the opposite-color candles (the order blocks)

*** In a bullish swing: find the last down-close candle(s) immediately before the strong bullish displacement. That is a bullish Order Block (OB) — mark the full range (high → low) of that candle (or cluster if multiple).

*** In a bearish swing: find the last up-close candle(s) immediately before the strong bearish displacement. That is a bearish OB — mark its full range.

*** Prefer clean single-candle OBs (no overlap by later candles). If there is a cluster of 2–3 opposite candles before the run, you can mark the cluster as the zone.

**  Mark nearby Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) & liquidity

*** Draw any FVGs left by the displacement — these are additional magnet zones.

*** Mark obvious liquidity above old highs and below old lows (these explain temporary violations).

**  The validation test — what “shouldn’t be violated” means

*** Bullish scenario: price retraces into the down-close OB/FVG. The low created as it rebalances (the retracement low inside the OB/FVG) should not be closed below by price if bias remains bullish. If price closes below that low with meaningful displacement, the bullish bias is suspect/invalid.

*** Bearish scenario: price retraces into the up-close OB/FVG. The high formed in that rebalance should not be closed above by price if bias remains bearish. A clean close above that high invalidates the bearish bias.

*** In short: the retracement high (for bearish reads) or retracement low (for bullish reads) is the “line in the sand.”

**  How to watch for acceptable exceptions (liquidity grabs)

*** A temporary violation of the OB is allowed if:

*** It’s a quick wick / spike that reaches a nearby swing high/low to grab stops, and

*** Price reclaims the OB quickly (e.g., within a few candles and without a strong follow-through that breaks structure).

*** If the violation is followed by continued closes beyond the OB and structure breaks, treat it as bias invalidation.

** Entries, stops, and confirmation rules

*** Entry (bullish): wait for price to retrace into the bullish OB/FVG and show a bullish rejection candle (e.g., bullish engulf, strong close back above OB, or long lower wick + bullish close). Place entry on the close above the confirmation candle or on a break of its high.

*** Stop: below the OB low (or below nearby swing low for extra safety).

*** Take profit: target next structure level / liquidity pool / measured move. Aim for sensible R:R (≥1.5–2:1).

*** Mirror these for bearish trades (entry on bearish confirmation, stop above OB high).

** Invalidation & what to do when OBs fail

*** If a marked OB is overlapped / closed through by price (a full candle close beyond the OB) → immediately reassess:

*** Do not add to the trade; consider bias neutral until a new clean OB + displacement forms.

*** If multiple OBs fail on the same side, flip bias or wait for HTF confirmation.

** Quick practical checklist (use this every trade)

*** HTF trend: Bull / Bear / Neutral?

*** Structure: Higher highs / Lower lows?

*** Candle-color dominance in the swing (majority up/down closes)?

*** Mark opposite-color OB(s) + FVGs.

*** Is price retracing into OB during a killzone or session of interest? (optional)

*** Look for confirmation candle inside/after OB.

*** Entry, stop, TP set.

*** If OB is violated by full close → stop/stand aside.

*** Example (concrete)

*** HTF 4H shows higher highs → HTF bullish.

*** On 1H swing from 1.0900 → 1.1050: 9 of 12 candles closed bullish → bullish dominance.

*** Identify the last down-close candle before the big push 1.0980–1.0990 → mark that as bullish OB (range 1.0985–1.0975).

*** Price retraces to 1.0980 (inside OB) and produces a long lower wick candle that closes bullish → enter long on close above that wick’s high; stop = 1.0970 (below OB).

*** If price had closed decisively below 1.0975 (OB low) → invalidate bullish bias and stand aside.

*** Do’s & Don’ts (fast)

*** Do require a full candle close to confirm OB invalidation — don’t react to wicks only.

*** Do use HTF alignment — LTF signals are stronger when HTF agrees.

*** Don’t assume a single opposite candle is always enough — context matters (swing length, nearby liquidity).

*** Don’t trade broken setups; waiting for a clean OB + confirmation reduces drawdowns.
* Trading FVG
** Bearish FVG Setup

*** Imagine you have 3 candles in a bearish move:

*** Candle 1 → large down close.

*** Candle 2 → continuation down.

*** Candle 3 → follows through.

*** The FVG is between:

**** High of Candle 3 and

**** Low of Candle 1.

**** Entry (short) → when price retraces back into the FVG.

**** Stop loss placement (ICT rule):

**** Conservatively → above the open of Candle 2.

**** More aggressive → above the open of Candle 1.

**** Reason: If price trades above those levels, the imbalance is “invalidated” (market may not be bearish anymore).

** Bullish FVG Setup

*** In a bullish move:

*** Candle 1 → large up close.

*** Candle 2 → continuation up.

*** Candle 3 → follows through.

*** The FVG is between:

**** Low of Candle 3 and

**** High of Candle 1.

**** Entry (long) → ICT often teaches to place entry at the close of Candle 1 (the origin of the move); buy on discount and sell on premium.

**** Stop loss placement → below the low of Candle 2 (sometimes Candle 1 depending on risk tolerance).

**** Reason: If the market is truly bullish, price should respect the origin of the move (Candle 1 close) and not break significantly below it.

*** Intuition (why this works)

**** FVGs are footprints of institutional buying/selling.

**** When price comes back to “rebalance,” you are basically entering with the institutions.

**** Stops are placed just beyond the point where the imbalance would no longer make sense.

** Rule of thumb from ICT:

*** Bearish → sell from FVG retrace, stop above the Candle 2 open (sell on premium)

*** Bullish → buy from FVG retrace, entry at Candle 1 close, stop below Candle 2 low (buy on discount)

* Build Bias: ICT London Session Judas Swing Model (Bearish Bias)
** Define the Previous Day’s Range

*** Draw a rectangle covering the high and low of the previous day.

**** Example:

**** High = 100

**** Low = 20

**** Range = 80 points/pips

** Mark the Opening Price (Anchor Point)

*** At 2:00 AM New York time (London open), mark the opening price.

*** That first 1-minute candle open is a key reference.

** Establish Context

*** If today’s opening price is below the previous day’s low (20 in the example) → bias is bearish.

*** This signals potential continuation lower, but ICT teaches: London usually runs liquidity first.

** Identify Liquidity Targets in Yesterday’s Range

*** Look inside yesterday’s range (20–100).

*** Find:

**** Equal highs

**** Or a single obvious high, especially if it’s in the lower 1/3 or 1/4 of the range.

**** These are pools of buy stops that institutions may target.

**  Anticipate the Judas Swing (False Move)

*** Around London open, expect price to:

*** Run above those equal/single highs (grab liquidity).

*** Then quickly reverse back down into bearish order flow.

*** Do not react impulsively to this spike. Expect it, let it happen.

** Trade Application

*** Aggressive scalpers: may buy the run up into the liquidity (but must be nimble — exit fast).

*** Higher-probability ICT model:

**** Wait for the Judas swing to finish.

**** Look for confirmation to short once price rejects above those highs.

**** Entry comes on retrace (OB/FVG), stop above Judas swing high, targeting liquidity lower.

** The Key Principle

*** London creates false breakouts.

*** They’re not “real breakouts” but engineered liquidity grabs.

*** Your job: wait for the trap → trade the reversal in line with bias.

** Formula in plain words:
*** If the day opens below yesterday’s low and you are bearish, then inside yesterday’s range look for highs (equal or single) in the lower portion. Around 2:00 AM NY time, anticipate price will run up into those highs (the Judas swing) and then reverse down.
