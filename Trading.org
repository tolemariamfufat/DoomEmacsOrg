* PD Array
** Bearish Pd Array Matrix
=> Old High or low
=> Rejection block
=> Bearish order block
=> Fair value gap
=> Liquidity void
=> Bearish breaker block
=> Bearish mitigation block
** Buullish Pd Array Matrix
=> Bullish mitigation block
=> Bullish breaker
=> Liquidity void
=> Fair value gap
=> Bullish order block
=> Rejection block
=> Old low or high
** Intraweek Market Reversals
=> If price action moves faster than the last days of a week on Monday and Tuesday, it is going to meet price delivery and then reverses soon. Do not think that the speed of market movement as an opportunity to continue in the same bias.
=> On Wednesday and Thursday there is monthly reversal always.
* Internal range liquidity and market structure shift (2022, episode 3)
=> If the buystops of old highs are taken, market structure shift occurs;
=> If the buystops of old lows are taken, market structure shift occurs;
=> If market structure occurs, order blocks of higher highs and higher lows or lower highs and loser lows will be violated;
=> Order blocks are change in a state of price delivery, hence they go in line with market structure shaft.
* Intraday Order Flow and Understanding the Daily Range (2022, episode 5 for indicies)
=> S&P 500 E-Mini (Sep,Dec,Marc, June), daily range = 8:30-12:00 Am and 13:00-16:30 pm, (Lunch time donor trade 12:00-13:00)
* Market structure: Long term high/low, Intermediate term high/low and short term high/low
=> Long term high/low is a framework it is at high time frame
=> Intermediate term high/low balances FVG of LTH/LTL
=> Intermediate term high/low are two types:
        => The one which has Short term high/low below to the right and left; this one shows the market is strong
        => The one which has Short term/low above to the right and left; this one shows the market so weak.
        => Short term high/lows are order blocks which are failed or resisted
* Institutional order flow
=> The idea is that when you see an imbalance get re balance, the high formed as it re balances the high shouldn't violated by price going higher than that if you are bearish or lower if you are bullish. If you blend this with an institutional order flow. What is an institutional order flow? When you are bearish all of your up closed candles should keep price from going upper than them. When you are bullish when price is moving higher, predominantly there is going to be more up closed candles; but down close candles should support price if it trades back down to them it's going to act as a support structure for an order block.
=> Whenever we are bullish we are expecting a price swing higher generally there is not a lot of down close candles in that price swing higher but those down closed candles should support price should it trade back down into them and not see them overlapped in other words, going down blow it if it does it only permissible if there is a short term low in close proximity to it and it then like just go down and take out some sell stops if it is bullish and then re accumulate and go higher if there is no swing low, there would be no swing sell side below it so there is nothing to concern yourself with just look for down close candles to support price higher.
=> If these set ups broken do not trade wait for more well formed setup.

* Setup
=> If you are bullish and the middle night open is (Easter or New York time zone) above the 8:30 am open, then it is in discount so it is good buying opportunity because it so cheap. This is algorithmic and it repeats but it may stop some days in some markets. You may find in fore but not in bonds or in indices. But there is a setup like this every single week. You can have a move below 8:30 and then it moves upward. That is normal.

=> If you are bearish and the midnight open candle is (eastern or New York time zone) below the 8:30 am open, then it is in premium so it is good selling opportunity because it so expensive. This is algorithmic and it repeats but it may stop some days in some markets. You may find in fore but not in bonds or in indices. But there is a setup like this every single week. You can have a move above 8:30 and then it moves down. That is normal.

=> Use the setup Daily -> Hourly -> 15 Minutes -> 3 Minutes/2 Minutes/1 Minutes
=> For entry check ICT 2022 episodes 19,20
=> Divide the target price action into levels
=> You sell in premium that is above equilibrium; you do not sell in discount; do not lose money.
=> You buy in discount that is above equilibrium; you do not buy in premium, do not lose money.
=> You must place sell or buy order on a FVG; and sell or buy stop above/below the previous candle.
=> If you couldn't find FVG on Daily go to Hourly, if you couldn't find FVG on hourly go to 15M or 3 minute or 2 or 1 minute; you will get it. You should obey this rule if you do not want to lose your money.
** Foundation for setup (2022 ICT Mentorship, Episode 24)
=> You have a level of relative equal highs and price is moving towards it, and small corrections, and finally it runs through those relatively highs. As soon as it goes above it, you start planning back through  all this price running there. And you should find the nearest short term low because that right there is going to be your trigger. It is not that it goes above this old relative equal high and then goes down below that. It has to go below the short term low and displacement with energetic move take out short term low. That is how you filter out these trades that  not be high probability. Until it takes that short term low, there is nothing going on, no trade, no setup there at all. Then when there is displacement that  leg and price action that right there is your foundation to the setup. Once you have that then  you can go into that area and look for the FVG. That is the logic, that is the pattern that is what you are looking for. That is if the bias is bearish. Before it ran to those relative equal highs, you have to look for down there price was trading down into that area was showing you your interest today and you are watching the price action where it was likely to go down to the low little gap so you were expecting this type of movement. So These two scenarios must be fulfilled for the setup. If there is no movement down there would be no trade that moves to old highs.

=> In reverse, you can trade long positions. The logic is the same.
