* ICT Market Structure and Intraweek Reversals
** Intraweek Market Reversals
*** Fast Moves Early in the Week (Mon–Tue)
*** If price runs aggressively on Monday/Tuesday, it often exhausts liquidity early.
*** This usually leads to a reversal midweek, so don’t assume early-week momentum will continue.
*** Midweek Reversal (Wed–Thu)
*** Historically, Wednesday and Thursday often produce monthly or weekly turning points.
*** These days mark when the market shifts away from the earlier move, hunting liquidity in the opposite direction.
** Internal Range Liquidity & Market Structure Shift (MSS)
*** Liquidity Sweeps Trigger MSS
*** When old highs’ buy stops or lows’ sell stops are taken, it signals a Market Structure Shift (MSS).
*** Impact on Order Blocks
**** An MSS invalidates previous order blocks (e.g., higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows).
**** Since order blocks reflect a change in price delivery, they align with MSS events.
** Intraday Order Flow & Daily Range (S&P 500 Example)
*** Trading Sessions
*** Active ranges:
**** 8:30 – 12:00 pm (NY time) → Morning session.
**** 1:00 – 4:30 pm → Afternoon session.
**** 12:00 – 1:00 pm (Lunch) → Low volume, best to avoid trading.
** Market Structure Hierarchy
*** Long-Term High/Low (LTH/LTL)
*** Higher-timeframe framework Sets the overall directional bias.
*** Intermediate-Term High/Low (ITH/ITL): Acts to rebalance Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) within the long-term range.
**** Two types:
***** Strong Market → Short-term highs/lows appear below the ITH/ITL (shows continuation strength).
***** Weak Market → Short-term highs/lows appear above the ITH/ITL (shows likely reversal).
*** Short-Term High/Low (STH/STL): Often associated with failed or resisted order blocks. These are tactical levels where liquidity gets taken.
** Key Takeaways
*** Early-week speed often traps traders; midweek is when reversals form.
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS) occurs when liquidity at old highs/lows is taken, often invalidating prior order blocks.
*** S&P 500 intraday has two main tradable sessions (morning and afternoon).
*** Structure exists in layers (long-term → intermediate → short-term), with intermediate highs/lows showing the strength or weakness of trend.
* Institutional order flow
** The Core Idea
*** IOF = the direction institutions are delivering price.
*** It’s read by watching how price reacts around imbalances and opposite-color candles.
*** If price respects those “institutional footprints,” order flow is intact.
*** If those structures break, the order flow is violated → don’t trade.
** Bearish Institutional Order Flow
*** In a bearish environment:
**** Market leaves imbalances (FVGs) to the downside.
**** When price retraces to rebalance those imbalances, the highs formed during that retrace should not be broken higher.
**** All up-close candles in the swing act as resistance order blocks.
**** If price trades above those up-close candles, IOF is broken → bias is invalid.
**  Bullish Institutional Order Flow
*** In a bullish environment:
**** Market leaves imbalances (FVGs) to the upside.
**** Price retraces into the imbalance and should respect the down-close candles (bullish OBs).
**** These down-close candles act as support structures.
**** If price cuts below these candles, it invalidates the order flow unless there’s a nearby swing low that must be cleared first (a sell-side liquidity raid).
**  Special Note on Down-Close Candles in Bullish Moves
*** In bullish swings, most candles will close up.
*** The few down-close candles become very important.
*** They should act as support when price retraces.
*** If they are overlapped and broken, the bullish IOF is no longer clean.
** Liquidity Exception
*** If a down-close candle is violated only because price is taking a nearby swing low (sell-side liquidity), that’s still consistent with bullish IOF.
*** After the liquidity grab, price can re-accumulate and continue higher.
** Trading Rule
*** Respect IOF structure.
*** If the opposite-color candles (order blocks) are violated improperly, do not trade.
*** Wait for a new, well-formed setup aligned with clean IOF.
** Summary in Plain Words
*** Bearish IOF → up-close candles = resistance. Their highs shouldn’t be broken.
*** Bullish IOF → down-close candles = support. Their lows shouldn’t be broken.
*** If they are broken without a liquidity reason, IOF is invalid → sit out.
* ICT Setup Model (2022 Mentorship)
** Time & Anchor Points
*** Midnight Open (00:00 EST/NY time) → reference anchor.
*** 8:30 AM Open (EST/NY time) → reference anchor.
*** Compare these two opens:
**** Bullish bias: Midnight open above 8:30 open → market is in discount → good for buys.
**** Bearish bias: Midnight open below 8:30 open → market is in premium → good for sells.
**** Note: This setup repeats weekly in Forex (less in bonds/indices).
** Premium / Discount Logic
*** Sell only in premium (above equilibrium).
*** Buy only in discount (below equilibrium).
*** Never flip the rule → that’s how you avoid unnecessary losses.
** Price Action Filtering
*** You need a liquidity run first:
**** Bearish case:
***** Price runs above relative equal highs (old high).
***** Then displaces lower and breaks a short-term low.
***** That’s your confirmation.
**** Bullish case:
***** Price runs below relative equal lows (old low).
***** Then displaces higher and breaks a short-term high.
***** That’s your confirmation.
***** No displacement through a short-term high/low = no valid setup.
** Execution Rule
**** Entry must be on a Fair Value Gap (FVG) in the displacement leg.
***** Stop placement:
***** Daily → Hourly → 15M → 3M → 2M → 1M.
***** There will always be an FVG at some fractal level.
** Trade Management
*** Target: levels of liquidity (equal highs, equal lows, or imbalance fills).
*** Divide the move into levels (partials can be taken at each).
*** Follow strict model → if setup breaks (order flow invalid), do not trade.
** Core Principle (Foundation): a setup requires two conditions:
*** Liquidity Run
***** The market doesn’t move randomly; it seeks liquidity.
***** Liquidity usually rests above old highs (buy stops) or below old lows (sell stops).
***** A “liquidity run” means price has reached above a prior high or below a prior low, triggering stop orders.
*** Displacement + Break of Short-Term Structure
**** Displacement = a strong, impulsive move in one direction (fast, wide-bodied candles). It shows intent by “smart money.”
**** After displacement, you want to see a short-term structure break:
**** If liquidity was swept above highs, you want to see a sharp move down breaking a recent low → bearish setup.
**** If liquidity was swept below lows, you want to see a sharp move up breaking a recent high → bullish setup.
**** This structure break confirms the liquidity grab wasn’t just a continuation but the start of a reversal.
*** Putting It Together
**** A valid setup = liquidity run + displacement with structure break.
**** Without the liquidity run → you don’t know where stops were taken.
**** Without the displacement + BOS → the market hasn’t confirmed intent.
**** So this “core principle” is basically the foundation for finding high-probability reversals.
** Quick Bias Rule (Episode 25)
*** Bearish = Old high taken → then old low taken.
*** Bullish = Old low taken → then old high taken.
** Summary in Plain Words:
*** Use the midnight and 8:30 opens to determine premium/discount. Look for liquidity raids (old highs/lows). Require displacement + short-term break to confirm bias. Enter at the FVG. Always buy in discount, sell in premium.
* ICT Counter-Trend Context Model
** Big Picture (Higher Time frame Bias)
*** Start with the higher time frame (Daily or 4H).
*** Confirm the market is in a long-term bearish move (downtrend).
*** A counter-trend setup = looking for short-term bullish retracement trades inside that bearish trend.
** Define the Objective (Draw on Liquidity)
*** A counter-trend trade must aim for a clear liquidity pool above current price.
**** Examples:
***** Relative equal highs.
***** A clean swing high.
***** A daily imbalance or order block.
***** If there is no higher-time frame liquidity target, do not take a counter-trend trade.
**  Wait for Discount Retracement Zone
*** Drop into lower time frames (1H, 15M).
*** Watch for price to retrace into a discount area of the short-term range.
*** In that discount zone, look for:
*** Fair Value Gap (FVG).
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS) → break of short-term high.
*** Down-close order block acting as support.
**  Execution Logic
*** Entry: in the FVG or OB inside the discount zone.
*** Stop loss: below the short-term low.
*** Target: the higher-timeframe liquidity (your Draw on Liquidity).
**  Patience Rule
*** If price runs impulsively to the objective (liquidity) without retracing into your discount entry zone →
*** ❌ No trade.
*** Only enter when ICT rules align.
**  Time of Day Context
*** New York Lunch (11:30 AM – 1:30 PM NY time):
*** Market often prints equal highs during this slow period.
*** In counter-trend context, price may later rally through those equal highs as it seeks the higher-timeframe liquidity.
** Summary
*** Counter-trend = trading retracements against the big bias.
*** Must have:
**** Higher-timeframe bearish context.
**** A clear liquidity target (draw on liquidity).
**** Discount zone + FVG + MSS on lower timeframe for entry.
**** Discipline to wait if no retracement forms.
**** Awareness of NY Lunch equal highs as staging areas for liquidity runs.
* When to buy
** ICT advises "buy on Wednesday on New York session".
** Pay attention to Accumulation, Manipulation (creating low/high of the day), distribution (expansion); that is power of AMD!
* Narrative (Precise Explanation)
** Definition: Narrative is the logical expectation of where price is likely to go, based on liquidity and price action — not indicators. It answers: “Where is the draw on liquidity?”
** Validation: A narrative is proven when price behavior confirms the logic (e.g., sweeping liquidity, respecting a fair value gap, or shifting structure).
** Process:
*** Identify higher-timeframe levels (e.g., 15M fair value gaps).
*** Watch how price reacts when it trades into those areas.
*** Drop to a lower timeframe (e.g., 5M) to refine entries once structure shifts or imbalances rebalance.
*** Track the sequence: accumulation → manipulation → distribution.
** Key Principle: Always align lower-timeframe trading with higher-timeframe context; otherwise, you’re trading blindly.
*** Example (Bullish Scenario):
*** Midnight opens higher than 8:30.
*** Price rallies into the morning, retraces before lunch, then rallies again in the afternoon targeting the previous day’s high.
** Key takeaway: Narrative is about reading price behavior logically across timeframes to anticipate liquidity draws, not relying on indicators or static support/resistance.
* T.G.I.F. Setup (ICT Concept)
** Meaning: “Thank God It’s Friday” setup — a pattern unique to Friday trading behavior.
** Core Idea: After a strong directional move during the week, Friday often delivers a weekly retracement.
** Retracement Target: Typically returns to 20%–30% of the weekly range.
** Context:
*** Best observed when price has already reached a higher timeframe objective (e.g., premium/discount zones).
*** Confluence often comes from Judas Swings (false moves) and Market Structure Shifts (MSS) on intraday charts.
*** Timing: Commonly plays out in the New York afternoon session, when profit-taking occurs.
** Key takeaway: The T.G.I.F. setup uses Friday’s tendency for retracement to capture a reversal or pullback after the week’s main move, especially when aligned with higher-timeframe objectives.
* Time and Price
** Price is delivered by an algorism; there is no buying or selling pressure.
** Algorithmic theory is based on Time and Price.
** Price levels are useless until time is considered.
** Time is of no use unless price is at a key PD array.
** Blending the two yields astonishing results & precision. 
* Key to Daily Bias
** Every day bias is unrealistic;
** Determine the likely weekly expansion;
** Look for obvious liquidity in that direction;
** Identify imbalances 
** Focus on the high or medium calendar event dates;
** Look for directional price runs in my kill zones intraday.
** You do not have trade every single day, there are days when you cannot trade. 
* Algo
** The Algo will not allow price to drop under a FVG as it tracts the buy side liquidity which has been already taken. The price action movement is not determined by supply demand or support Resistance, it is determined by Algo. 
* London Session (ICT perspective) – Simplified
*** Best Pairs: EUR & GBP, since they’re most active in London.
*** Key Time (ICT Kill Zone): 2:00 am – 5:00 am New York time.
*** Market Behavior:
**** London often sets either the High of the Day (if daily trend is bearish) or the Low of the Day (if daily trend is bullish).
**** Price may initially sweep one side (drop then rally, or rally then drop) to form liquidity, then reverse in the direction of the day’s bias.
*** Scalping Opportunity: Frequently offers 25–50 pip setups around London Open.
*** Daily Bias Connection:
**** If the daily trend is bullish, expect London to post the Low of the Day.
**** If the daily trend is bearish, expect London to post the High of the Day.
**** Range Formation: Comparing the London low with the following swing (New York session) often defines the day’s trading range.
**** Applicability: The same behavior shows up across FX, crypto, indices, commodities, and bonds.
*** Key takeaway: The London session has the highest probability of forming the day’s high or low, making it a prime opportunity to align with the daily bias and capture large portions of the daily range.
* ICT Price & Time Grid Cheat Sheet
** Price Action Grid (Where Liquidity Sits)
*** Old Highs → Buy stops above (liquidity).
*** Old Lows → Sell stops below (liquidity).
*** Liquidity Run → First raid is fake-out, second raid shows true direction.
*** Displacement → Strong break of structure confirms bias.
*** Order Blocks (OBs) → Last opposing candle before displacement (entry zones).
*** Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) → Imbalances where price often returns for entries.
➡ Sequence: Liquidity → Sweep → Displacement → OB / FVG → Expansion.
**  Time Grid (When Liquidity Gets Taken)
*** Daily Cycle
****  Asian Range (00:00–05:00 GMT)
Market consolidates, builds liquidity.
****  London Killzone (07:00–10:00 GMT / 02:00–05:00 EST)
Stop hunts: often takes Asia’s high/low.
****  New York AM (12:00–15:00 GMT / 07:00–10:00 EST)
Main move of the day, displacement + setups.
****  New York PM (17:00–19:00 GMT / 12:00–14:00 EST)
Reversal or continuation into close.
*** Weekly Cycle
**** Mon–Tue → Weekly high or low often forms.
**** Wed–Thu → Expansion in real direction.
**** Fri → Profit taking, reversals, consolidation.
***  How to Combine Them
**** Step 1: Mark old highs & lows (yesterday’s, weekly, Asia session).
**** Step 2: Wait for liquidity run during killzones (London & NY).
**** Step 3: Identify which liquidity gets swept first (old high or old low).
**** Step 4: Confirm with displacement in opposite direction.
**** Step 5: Enter on retrace to OB or FVG in killzone.
***  Examples
**** Bearish Day Example
**** Asia consolidates.
**** London takes Asia’s high (buy stops).
**** NY AM breaks down through Asia/London low with displacement.
**** Retrace to OB/FVG → Short.
**** Bullish Week Example
**** Monday sweeps previous week’s low.
**** Wednesday breaks up with displacement.
**** Retrace to OB/FVG → Long into Thursday.
* Criterion to determine bias
=> Nice — below is a practical, step-by-step workflow you can run on any chart to determine bias using the ICT idea that opposite-color candles become support/resistance (i.e. order blocks). Follow this exactly on your chart and you’ll get consistent, repeatable reads.
**  Pick your timeframes
*** Higher timeframe (HTF) = trend anchor (4H / Daily).
*** Lower timeframe (LTF) = entries and order-block validation (1H / 15m).
*** Always require HTF and LTF alignment: if HTF is bullish, prefer bullish setups on LTF.
**  Define the current structure (swing high / swing low)
*** Mark the most recent swing high and most recent swing low on the HTF.
*** Ask: did structure break to new highs (higher highs / higher lows) or new lows (lower lows / lower highs)? That tells you the initial directional tilt.
**  Measure candle-color dominance (quick bias heuristic)
*** On the swing (from swing low → swing high or vice versa), count the closes of the candles:
*** If majority are up-close candles (close > open) → bullish tilt.
*** If majority are down-close candles (close < open) → bearish tilt.
*** Give extra weight if those same-direction candles have bigger bodies and break structure (displacement).
*** Rule of thumb: majority over the last 8–12 candles in the swing; if 60%+ same color and structure is in that direction, bias leans that way.
**  Identify the opposite-color candles (the order blocks)
*** In a bullish swing: find the last down-close candle(s) immediately before the strong bullish displacement. That is a bullish Order Block (OB) — mark the full range (high → low) of that candle (or cluster if multiple).
*** In a bearish swing: find the last up-close candle(s) immediately before the strong bearish displacement. That is a bearish OB — mark its full range.
*** Prefer clean single-candle OBs (no overlap by later candles). If there is a cluster of 2–3 opposite candles before the run, you can mark the cluster as the zone.
**  Mark nearby Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) & liquidity
*** Draw any FVGs left by the displacement — these are additional magnet zones.
*** Mark obvious liquidity above old highs and below old lows (these explain temporary violations).
**  The validation test — what “shouldn’t be violated” means
*** Bullish scenario: price retraces into the down-close OB/FVG. The low created as it rebalances (the retracement low inside the OB/FVG) should not be closed below by price if bias remains bullish. If price closes below that low with meaningful displacement, the bullish bias is suspect/invalid.
*** Bearish scenario: price retraces into the up-close OB/FVG. The high formed in that rebalance should not be closed above by price if bias remains bearish. A clean close above that high invalidates the bearish bias.
*** In short: the retracement high (for bearish reads) or retracement low (for bullish reads) is the “line in the sand.”
**  How to watch for acceptable exceptions (liquidity grabs)
*** A temporary violation of the OB is allowed if:
*** It’s a quick wick / spike that reaches a nearby swing high/low to grab stops, and
*** Price reclaims the OB quickly (e.g., within a few candles and without a strong follow-through that breaks structure).
*** If the violation is followed by continued closes beyond the OB and structure breaks, treat it as bias invalidation.
** Entries, stops, and confirmation rules
*** Entry (bullish): wait for price to retrace into the bullish OB/FVG and show a bullish rejection candle (e.g., bullish engulf, strong close back above OB, or long lower wick + bullish close). Place entry on the close above the confirmation candle or on a break of its high.
*** Stop: below the OB low (or below nearby swing low for extra safety).
*** Take profit: target next structure level / liquidity pool / measured move. Aim for sensible R:R (≥1.5–2:1).
*** Mirror these for bearish trades (entry on bearish confirmation, stop above OB high).
** Invalidation & what to do when OBs fail
*** If a marked OB is overlapped / closed through by price (a full candle close beyond the OB) → immediately reassess:
*** Do not add to the trade; consider bias neutral until a new clean OB + displacement forms.
*** If multiple OBs fail on the same side, flip bias or wait for HTF confirmation.
** Quick practical checklist (use this every trade)
*** HTF trend: Bull / Bear / Neutral?
*** Structure: Higher highs / Lower lows?
*** Candle-color dominance in the swing (majority up/down closes)?
*** Mark opposite-color OB(s) + FVGs.
*** Is price retracing into OB during a killzone or session of interest? (optional)
*** Look for confirmation candle inside/after OB.
*** Entry, stop, TP set.
*** If OB is violated by full close → stop/stand aside.
*** Example (concrete)
*** HTF 4H shows higher highs → HTF bullish.
*** On 1H swing from 1.0900 → 1.1050: 9 of 12 candles closed bullish → bullish dominance.
*** Identify the last down-close candle before the big push 1.0980–1.0990 → mark that as bullish OB (range 1.0985–1.0975).
*** Price retraces to 1.0980 (inside OB) and produces a long lower wick candle that closes bullish → enter long on close above that wick’s high; stop = 1.0970 (below OB).
*** If price had closed decisively below 1.0975 (OB low) → invalidate bullish bias and stand aside.
*** Do’s & Don’ts (fast)
*** Do require a full candle close to confirm OB invalidation — don’t react to wicks only.
*** Do use HTF alignment — LTF signals are stronger when HTF agrees.
*** Don’t assume a single opposite candle is always enough — context matters (swing length, nearby liquidity).
*** Don’t trade broken setups; waiting for a clean OB + confirmation reduces drawdowns.
* Trading FVG
** Bearish FVG Setup
*** Imagine you have 3 candles in a bearish move:
*** Candle 1 → large down close.
*** Candle 2 → continuation down.
*** Candle 3 → follows through.
*** The FVG is between:
**** High of Candle 3 and
**** Low of Candle 1.
**** Entry (short) → when price retraces back into the FVG.
**** Stop loss placement (ICT rule):
**** Conservatively → above the open of Candle 2.
**** More aggressive → above the open of Candle 1.
**** Reason: If price trades above those levels, the imbalance is “invalidated” (market may not be bearish anymore).
** Bullish FVG Setup
*** In a bullish move:
*** Candle 1 → large up close.
*** Candle 2 → continuation up.
*** Candle 3 → follows through.
*** The FVG is between:
**** Low of Candle 3 and
**** High of Candle 1.
**** Entry (long) → ICT often teaches to place entry at the close of Candle 1 (the origin of the move); buy on discount and sell on premium.
**** Stop loss placement → below the low of Candle 2 (sometimes Candle 1 depending on risk tolerance).
**** Reason: If the market is truly bullish, price should respect the origin of the move (Candle 1 close) and not break significantly below it.
*** Intuition (why this works)
**** FVGs are footprints of institutional buying/selling.
**** When price comes back to “rebalance,” you are basically entering with the institutions.
**** Stops are placed just beyond the point where the imbalance would no longer make sense.
** Rule of thumb from ICT:
*** Bearish → sell from FVG retrace, stop above the Candle 2 open (sell on premium)
*** Bullish → buy from FVG retrace, entry at Candle 1 close, stop below Candle 2 low (buy on discount)
* Inversion FVG
*** Price Violates the FVG: Price moves through the Fair Value Gap with strong momentum instead of respecting it.
*** Role Reversal: The original FVG is no longer an area of expected support or resistance for a retracement; it becomes a new support or resistance level for the new, opposite directional move.
** Reclaimed (inverse) FVG
*** Original FVG Creation: A strong move (e.g., a rapid increase in a bullish trend) creates a Bullish FVG (expected to act as support when price returns).
*** Mitigation and Breakthrough (Reclaiming): Price returns to the Bullish FVG but, instead of finding support and reversing to continue the rally, it breaks down decisively through the entire gap and continues to move lower, suggesting a shift to a bearish market structure.
*** The Reclaimed Test: The market then retraces back up to the same zone (the previous Bullish FVG) which it has now successfully broken. The zone, which was expected to be support, is now "reclaimed" by the opposite side and is expected to act as a new resistance level.
* Build Bias: ICT London Session Judas Swing Model (Bearish Bias)
** Define the Previous Day’s Range
*** Draw a rectangle covering the high and low of the previous day.
**** Example:
**** High = 100
**** Low = 20
**** Range = 80 points/pips
** Mark the Opening Price (Anchor Point)
*** At 2:00 AM New York time (London open), mark the opening price.
*** That first 1-minute candle open is a key reference.
** Establish Context
*** If today’s opening price is below the previous day’s low (20 in the example) → bias is bearish.
*** This signals potential continuation lower, but ICT teaches: London usually runs liquidity first.
** Identify Liquidity Targets in Yesterday’s Range
*** Look inside yesterday’s range (20–100).
*** Find:
**** Equal highs
**** Or a single obvious high, especially if it’s in the lower 1/3 or 1/4 of the range.
**** These are pools of buy stops that institutions may target.
**  Anticipate the Judas Swing (False Move)
*** Around London open, expect price to:
*** Run above those equal/single highs (grab liquidity).
*** Then quickly reverse back down into bearish order flow.
*** Do not react impulsively to this spike. Expect it, let it happen.
** Trade Application
*** Aggressive scalpers: may buy the run up into the liquidity (but must be nimble — exit fast).
*** Higher-probability ICT model:
**** Wait for the Judas swing to finish.
**** Look for confirmation to short once price rejects above those highs.
**** Entry comes on retrace (OB/FVG), stop above Judas swing high, targeting liquidity lower.
** The Key Principle
*** London creates false breakouts.
*** They’re not “real breakouts” but engineered liquidity grabs.
*** Your job: wait for the trap → trade the reversal in line with bias.
** Formula in plain words:
*** If the day opens below yesterday’s low and you are bearish, then inside yesterday’s range look for highs (equal or single) in the lower portion. Around 2:00 AM NY time, anticipate price will run up into those highs (the Judas swing) and then reverse down.
* Pullback and inducement
** Pullback (General Idea)
*** A pullback is a temporary move against the dominant trend:
*** In a bullish market, the pullback is a move downward (retracement before price continues up).
*** In a bearish market, the pullback is a move upward (retracement before price continues down).
*** So it’s not a reversal—it’s just the market taking “a breath” before continuing.
** Valid Pullback
*** Not every little wick or pause is a real pullback. To be considered valid, it must show that liquidity has been taken or structure has been confirmed.
*** Bullish Market: For a pullback to be valid, the low of the highest candle must be broken (swept).
*** Bearish Market: For a pullback to be valid, the high of the lowest candle must be broken (swept).
*** The “validation” comes from liquidity being taken (stop hunts at previous candle high/low) or a candle close beyond that level.
*** Important: You don’t need the immediate next candle to do this. The confirmation can come a few candles later, as long as the prior high/low is eventually taken.
** Inducement
*** Inducement means the market is “tricking” traders into entering early before the real move.
*** In bullish conditions: price may start to dip, forming what looks like a pullback, but hasn’t swept the required low of the highest candle yet. Traders jump in too early, thinking it’s already a pullback. The market then goes lower to induce liquidity, sweeping those premature buyers’ stops, validating the pullback, and then the real continuation begins.
*** So: Inducement = false start / liquidity trap.
*** Valid pullback = after liquidity sweep or structural break.
** In simple terms:
*** A pullback is just price going against the main trend.
*** A valid pullback must sweep liquidity (previous high/low of the swing candle) or close beyond it.
*** Inducement is when price fakes a pullback before sweeping the real liquidity and making a true one.
* Mastering Daily Candle Bias
** Core Idea
*** Price often seeks liquidity, which usually sits around previous highs and lows (stop losses, pending orders, trapped traders). The market tends to “draw” toward these levels.
*** You’re defining rules for bias (bullish/bearish) based on how the current daily candle interacts with the previous day’s high and low.
** Sell Bias – Sweep Previous High, Close Below It
*** Condition: Current daily candle trades above the previous daily high (liquidity grab), but closes below that high.
*** Meaning: Buyers who entered on breakout are trapped, and liquidity above the high has been collected.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily low (downward bias).
** Buy Bias – Close Above Previous High
*** Condition: Current daily candle closes above the previous daily high.
*** Meaning: Market shows strength and continuation after breaking resistance.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily high (bullish continuation).
** Sell Bias – Close Below Previous Low
*** Condition: Current daily candle closes below the previous daily low.
*** Meaning: Market shows weakness and continuation after breaking support.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily low (bearish continuation).
** Buy Bias – Sweep Previous Low, Close Above It
*** Condition: Current daily candle trades below the previous daily low (liquidity grab), but closes above that low.
*** Meaning: Sellers who entered on breakdown are trapped, and liquidity below the low has been collected.
*** Expectation: Next liquidity draw is to the previous daily high (upward bias).
** Simplified Framework
*** Sweep but close back inside → Reversal bias
*** Break and close outside → Continuation bias
* ICT Wick Grading Points
** Close (Starting/Ending Point): This is the price level where the real body of the candlestick ends and the wick begins.
=> For an upper wick, it's the top of the body; for a lower wick, it's the bottom of the body. It marks the boundary of the price that was sustained by the majority of the session's action.
** Lower Quadrant (25% Mark): This is the level that represents 25% of the total wick range, measured starting from the Close toward the extreme High/Low.
=> It's the first quarter of the wick. A strong reversal (rejection) will often only retrace into this first quadrant before continuing its move away from the wick's extreme.
** Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) - Half Way Point (50% Mark): The Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) is the 50% midpoint of the entire wick.
=> In ICT, the C.E. of any significant price range (like a wick or a Fair Value Gap) is a highly significant institutional reference point. It is often where price is expected to react or reverse upon a future retest.
=> If price retests the wick and is strongly rejected at or before the C.E., it suggests the original move (that formed the wick) has strong directional conviction. A move beyond the C.E. is often viewed as a sign of weakness in the original directional bias.
** Upper Quadrant (75% Mark): This is the level that represents 75% of the total wick range, measured starting from the Close toward the extreme High/Low.
=> This is the final quarter of the wick before the extreme. If price retests the wick and reaches this level, it suggests that the rejection that created the wick was relatively weak, or that the market is attempting to completely "fill" the void left by the wick.
** High / Low (Extreme Point): This is the absolute peak or trough of the price movement during the candle's duration.
=> It represents the final point of liquidity or "stop-loss cluster" that was likely targeted by the market makers before the strong reversal (rejection) occurred. If price trades through this point, the initial wick is considered fully violated and its significance as a reference point is lost.
** Wick Context: Premium vs. Discount: This grading system is particularly relevant when the wick is analyzed within the context of the larger price range:
*** Premium Wick (Upper Wick): A long upper wick formed when the price is in a Premium Zone (typically the upper 50% of a swing move). The wick represents a push higher to grab Buy-Side Liquidity before a move lower. You grade the upper wick's range to find potential entry or stop-loss refinement points for a short trade.
** Discount Wick (Lower Wick): A long lower wick formed when the price is in a Discount Zone (typically the lower 50% of a swing move). The wick represents a push lower to grab Sell-Side Liquidity before a move higher. You grade the lower wick's range to find potential entry or stop-loss refinement points for a long trade.
*** In summary, the grading system provides a precise way to measure and anticipate price reaction to the liquidity void left behind by a significant wick, with the Consequent Encroachment (50%) being the most critical level to monitor for a reaction.
** The Role of HTF Wicks in LTF Trading
*** Higher Timeframe Wick: Context and Liquidity
**** A long wick on an HTF candle (e.g., Daily) signifies a decisive move by institutional traders, often referred to as a Liquidity Sweep or Stop Hunt.
**** The Wick's Extreme (High/Low): This is the area where the "Smart Money" likely swept stop-loss orders or pending entries before reversing the price. It marks a critical boundary that the market failed to sustain.
**** The Wick's Graded Levels (C.E., Quadrants): By grading the wick (finding the 25%, Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) at 50%, and 75% levels), you are marking institutional reference points that price is likely to react to upon a future retest.
*** Lower Timeframe Trading: Entry and Confirmation
**** When the price later returns to the area of this significant HTF wick, you drop down to your LTF (e.g., 1-Minute) to watch for an entry setup.
**** HTF Wick Component	LTF Interpretation and Use
**** HTF Wick (Entire Area)	Becomes your Target Zone or Entry Zone.
**** Consequent Encroachment (C.E.) of the Wick	This is your High-Probability Entry Level. You wait for the price to trade to or near the C.E. on the LTF.
**** Price Action at the C.E.	You look for a Change in the LTF Market Structure (e.g., a break of a local low/high, formation of a Fair Value Gap, or an Order Block) to confirm the HTF directional bias is now active on the LTF.
****** Example Scenario (Bullish Reversal)
******   HTF (Daily): A Discount Wick (long lower wick) forms on the Daily chart, suggesting price was rejected from a cheap/discounted price level after sweeping sell-side liquidity.
****** LTF (1-Minute): The market starts moving back up, but then begins a small retracement. You mark the C.E. (50% point) of the Daily wick.
****** The Trade: When the price on the 1-Minute chart trades back down into the area around the Daily wick's C.E., you look for a tiny Market Structure Shift (e.g., a break of the most recent high on the 1-Minute chart) to confirm institutional buying is resuming. You enter the long trade with a tight stop-loss below the C.E. or the wick's low.
****** In short, the Daily wick gives you the conviction and the key levels, while the 1-Minute chart gives you the precision entry and risk management.
* London and New York Continuation and Reversals
** New York Continuation (Most Common)
*** This is the most frequent scenario where the New York Open confirms and continues the direction established by London.
*** London's Action (Your understanding): Price goes up to sweep liquidity/stop losses (the "Judas Swing") above the Asian session high, then distributes down for the main move.
*** New York's Action (Continuation): Price will often retrace back up during the New York Open (specifically the New York Kill Zone, roughly 7:00 AM – 9:00 AM ET) to a key institutional level like a Fair Value Gap (FVG), an Order Block, or the Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) of the London move.
*** The Move: Once the retracement hits this point (the manipulation of the New York session), it then continues the distribution from the London session and drops lower to target the day's main objective (e.g., sell-side liquidity).
*** Pattern: Up (Retracement/Manipulation) → Down (Continuation).
** New York Reversal (Less Common)
*** This happens when the New York Open reverses the main directional move of the London session. This often occurs when the London move itself was the manipulation.
*** London's Action: Price goes up to sweep liquidity (manipulation) then begins to distribute down, but this downward move fails to achieve a major objective and runs into a Higher Timeframe (HTF) level (like a Daily/Weekly Order Block or FVG) right before New York opens.
*** New York's Action (Reversal): The New York Open will often make a final push down to clear liquidity below the London Low or run into that HTF level (the manipulation of the New York session).
*** The Move: After clearing that final low, price immediately reverses and rallies strongly up, effectively reversing the entire London move and closing the high-to-low range of the day.
*** Pattern: Down (Final Liquidity Sweep/Manipulation) → Up (Reversal).
*** In summary, the New York Open always involves a manipulative move (a liquidity grab or a deep retracement into an imbalance) before the final, larger distribution move for the session. The HTF bias and the overall Daily Profile are what determine whether that final move is a continuation or a reversal.

* "Mohawk"
** In the context of ICT trading (Inner Circle Trader), a "Mohawk" generally refers to a specific type of price action that is considered a slight deviation or an allowance for a small false move outside of a key anticipated price level or area.
** Here's a breakdown based on the common usage within the ICT community:
*** A Small Deviation: It's used to describe a price movement that momentarily pushes just outside the boundary of an area a trader is watching (like an order block or a volume imbalance), but then quickly reverses.
*** Candlestick Appearance: On a lower timeframe chart (e.g., a one-minute chart), this move might look like a few small candle bodies pushing out. However, when viewed on a slightly higher timeframe (e.g., a five-minute chart), this price action often consolidates into just a long wick or "shadow" on a single candle, with the body closing back within the anticipated range.
*** Liquidity Grab: It often represents a very quick liquidity grab or a "stop hunt" by large institutional players (the "smart money") that runs slightly past a previous high or low to trigger stop-loss orders before the price reverses and continues in the expected direction.
*** Trader Expectation: The concept suggests that a skilled ICT trader should anticipate and allow for this slight "Mohawk" move without being stopped out or losing confidence in their trade idea, understanding that a perfect reversal right at the line is rare.
*** In essence, the term "Mohawk" helps describe a type of brief, manipulative excursion of price that is common in the market, often resulting in a noticeable wick on a higher-timeframe chart, and it's something ICT traders factor into their entry and stop-loss placement.
* Previous Day High and Low
** Liquidity Pools (The "Draw on Liquidity")
*** In the ICT framework, price is drawn to areas where large amounts of buy and sell orders are clustered. The PDH and PDL are prime examples of this:
*** PDH (Buy-Side Liquidity): A large number of buy-stop orders (from short sellers wanting to limit their loss) and buy-limit orders (from breakout traders) are placed just above the previous day's high. Price is often drawn to this level to "sweep" or "run" that liquidity.
*** PDL (Sell-Side Liquidity): A large number of sell-stop orders (from long buyers wanting to limit their loss) and sell-limit orders (from breakout traders) are placed just below the previous day's low. Price is often drawn to this level to "sweep" or "run" that liquidity.
*** The institutional traders ("Smart Money") need this clustered liquidity to fill their massive orders without moving the price against themselves. Therefore, price movements during the day are often framed around reaching and clearing one of these two external liquidity targets.
** Determining Intraday Bias
*** The market's reaction to the PDH and PDL provides a strong indication of the current day's directional bias:
*** Bullish Bias: If price sweeps the PDL and then quickly reverses and closes back inside the previous day's range, it suggests the sell-side liquidity was taken to fuel a move higher. The low has been put in.
*** been put in.
*** Continuation Bias: If price breaks and holds convincingly above the PDH or below the PDL, it signals a strong trending day is likely underway, and the previously broken level will often act as the first area of support/resistance on a pullback.
** High/Low of the Day Formation
*** According to ICT principles, the high or low of the day is often formed immediately after one of the major liquidity pools (like the PDH or PDL) is run, particularly during key Kill Zones (like the London Open or New York Open).
*** The Hunt: Institutions will push price to the PDH or PDL (a "liquidity hunt").
*** The Reversal: Once the stops are cleared, they often execute their true directional trade, causing a sharp reversal. This reversal point, which is just beyond the previous day's extreme, then becomes the high or low of the current trading day.
*** By marking the PDH and PDL, an ICT trader is essentially identifying the two most likely targets for institutional manipulation and the most probable candidates for the eventual high or low of the day.
* ICT Change in the State of Delivery (CISD)
** Bullish Candle Sweeps Liquidity (The Trap)
*** Event: "In bullish order block, if the last of the three candles sweep on liquidity..."
*** Last Candle: This is the last up-close (bullish/green) candle in the series, which is the potential Bearish Order Block candidate.
*** Sweep Liquidity: This candle pushes price above a previous high, a process often referred to as a Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL) Sweep or "Stop Hunt."
*** Institutional Action: Smart Money/institutions push the price just high enough to trigger the stop-loss orders of existing short traders and the buy-stop orders of breakout traders.
*** This executed liquidity provides the smart money with the necessary large volume of contracts to take their new short (sell) positions. This move completes the buying phase of their plan.
** The Change in the State of Delivery (The Confirmation)
*** Event: "...and the next candle moves below the open of the previous high candle, the market starts delivering sell side price."
*** The Next Candle: This is a down-close (bearish/red) candle that immediately follows the liquidity-sweeping candle.
*** Moves Below the Open: This bearish candle trades (and ideally closes) below the open of the previous bullish candle (the one that swept liquidity).
*** This specific price action—a move below the open of the last up-close candle—is the Change in the State of Delivery (CISD).
*** The last bullish candle was the "support" for the current buying campaign. By moving below its open, the market has symbolically invalidated that support.
*** It signifies that the aggressive selling from institutions (who just absorbed the liquidity from the sweep) is now overpowering the prior buying pressure.
** The Result: Sell-Side Price Delivery
*** Once the CISD is confirmed, the market is now in a sell-side delivery state.
*** The Bearish Order Block (B-OB): The last up-close candle that swept liquidity is now validated as a Bearish Order Block. This candle represents the point where significant institutional selling was injected into the market.
*** New Delivery State: The market's internal bias has flipped. Price is expected to continue moving lower as the algorithm is now programmed to deliver price more efficiently to the Sell-Side of the curve (i.e., lower prices) until it reaches the next major liquidity target or imbalance (like a Fair Value Gap or an opposing Order Block).
*** Trading Implication: Traders using this concept would now look to sell (go short) when the price retraces back up to test the high-probability Bearish Order Block or the imbalance left by the initial move down.
** Enter on FVG that overlaps with the low of order block on sell delivery and on the high of previous order block on buy side delivery.
* Mean Threshold
** The Concept of the Mean Threshold
*** The Mean Threshold is the 50% level of the Order Block candle's body (measuring from the Open to the Close, or High to Low, excluding the wicks in most high-probability definitions).
*** In the context of a Bearish Order Block (the last up-close candle before a large move down):
*** The entire candle represents a large volume of institutional selling being executed.
*** The Mean Threshold is the 50% mark of that concentrated activity.
** The Rule: Defense of the Mean Threshold
*** The rule states: For a Bearish Order Block to remain valid, price must not close above the Mean Threshold (50%) on the retracement/pullback.
*** Above 50% is considered the Premium half of the Order Block.
*** Below 50% is considered the Discount half.
** The Institutional Logic
*** The Mean Threshold is viewed as a line of "defense" for the institutions who initiated the move.
*** Maximum Concession: The Mean Threshold represents the maximum price concession that institutions are willing to allow the market to return to before continuing their sell program.
*** Unfilled Orders: Institutions are assumed to have a significant volume of unfilled sell orders remaining at or near the Order Block area. They are expected to let the price retrace into this zone to "mitigate" (fill) those remaining orders at an advantageous price (i.e., the highest price possible, which is why a retracement is needed).
*** Invalidation of Intent: If price not only trades above the Mean Threshold but actually closes above it, it signals that the original selling pressure was too weak to hold the center of its own price zone. It implies that a new wave of buyers (or a lack of sellers) has successfully pushed the price deep into the area of initial selling, negating the expected strong resistance.
** What Happens if it Closes Above the Mean Threshold?
*** If the price closes above the Mean Threshold of a Bearish Order Block, the Order Block is generally considered failed or invalidated for a high-probability trade setup.
*** The market is likely to continue pushing higher, potentially to the high of the Order Block candle or even above it, indicating that the Change in the State of Delivery (CISD) that formed the Order Block may have been a false signal, and the original bullish trend is resuming.
*** In short, the Mean Threshold is the critical filter that distinguishes a high-probability entry point from a potential trap. A close above it tells the ICT trader to abandon the short trade setup.
* Consequent Encroachment (CE)
** What is a Fair Value Gap (FVG)?
*** First, you must understand the FVG. An FVG (also known as an Imbalance or an Inefficiency) is a three-candle price pattern where the high of the first candle and the low of the third candle do not overlap.
*** This creates a "gap" or a void in price action, indicating that the market moved too quickly in one direction, leaving behind a zone where no counter-side orders were executed.
*** The market is highly likely to return to this zone to "fill" or "mitigate" the imbalance, as the price delivery algorithm seeks to re-establish a fair price.
** The Definition of Consequent Encroachment (CE)
*** The Consequent Encroachment (CE) is the exact midpoint (50%) of the range of the FVG.
*** You measure from the top of the FVG to the bottom of the FVG, and the 50% line is the CE.
** The Institutional Logic: Why CE is Important
*** Just like the Mean Threshold for an Order Block, the CE for an FVG serves as a critical filter and a high-probability entry or mitigation level.
*** Magnet and Mitigation Point: When price returns to the FVG, it is often attracted to the CE. This midpoint acts as the true value level where institutional orders are most likely to be filled. The institutions that created the original impulsive move will often have limit orders sitting at or near the CE to complete their large position at a better price.
*** Validation Filter: Price's reaction to the CE determines the strength of the original move:
*** In a Bullish FVG: If price retraces into the gap, it should ideally find support and reverse before closing below the CE. A close below the CE suggests the original buying pressure is weak, and the FVG is more likely to be completely filled or even broken through.
*** In a Bearish FVG: If price retraces into the gap, it should find resistance and reverse before closing above the CE. A close above the CE suggests the original selling pressure is weak, and the FVG is more likely to be completely filled or broken.
** CE as a Refined Entry or Target
*** Traders use the CE to create a higher-probability setup:
=> Zone	Action	Rule
=> Bullish FVG	Entry for Long	Wait for price to enter the FVG and touch or trade just below the CE before entering. This gives you a better entry price (a "discount" entry within the imbalance) 
=> Bearish FVG	Entry for Short	Wait for price to enter the FVG and touch or trade just above the CE before entering. This gives you a better entry price (a "premium" entry within the imbalance).
=> Target	Take Profit	The CE of a large FVG or other PD Array on a higher timeframe can be used as a high-probability take-profit target, as price often seeks out these midpoints.
*** Summary of the 50% Rule
=> Concept	Zone	50% Level Name	Rule (Bearish Context)
=> Order Block (OB)	The last up-close candle	Mean Threshold (MT)	Price must not close above the Mean Threshold on the retracement.
=> Fair Value Gap (FVG)	The price imbalance zone	Consequent Encroachment (CE)	Price must not close above the Consequent Encroachment on the retracement.
* Equilibrium
** Equilibrium as the 50% Midpoint
*** In price action trading, Equilibrium is mathematically defined as the 50% level of a price swing or range.
*** Identify a Range: This range is typically the distance between a recent Swing High and a recent Swing Low (or vice versa) on the chart.
*** Calculate the Midpoint: The 50% mark of that distance is the Equilibrium line.
*** The Fair Value Zone: When price is at this 50% level, it is considered to be at Fair Market Value.
** Discount and Premium Zones
*** The concept of Equilibrium is crucial because it divides the price range into two critical zones that guide trading decisions:
=> Price Zone	Location	Trading Bias	Institutional Logic
=> Premium	Above the 50% Equilibrium	Optimal to Sell (Short)	The price is considered "expensive" or overvalued for a long position. Institutions look to sell or take profit here.
=> Discount	Below the 50% Equilibrium	Optimal to Buy (Long)	The price is considered "cheap" or undervalued for a short position. Institutions look to buy or enter long positions here.
*** The Core Trading Rule
*** The main principle is: Never Buy in a Premium, and Never Sell in a Discount.
*** Institutional traders aim to buy assets when they are cheap (in the Discount zone) and sell assets when they are expensive (in the Premium zone) relative to the recent price action. Price will often move impulsively away from the Equilibrium and then retrace back toward it to seek liquidity for a better entry.
** Equilibrium in ICT Concepts
*** Equilibrium is applied to specific institutional price structures:
*** Optimal Trade Entry (OTE): The OTE (usually the 62%, 70.5%, or 79% Fibonacci levels) exists in the Discount (for buys) or Premium (for sells) zone, just beyond the Equilibrium. Traders wait for price to penetrate the 50% level and enter the deeper OTE zone for the highest probability entries.
*** Mean Threshold (MT) / Consequent Encroachment (CE): These are essentially the Equilibrium (50%) of an Order Block or a Fair Value Gap (FVG), respectively. They are used as precise confirmation levels to gauge the strength of the institutional block or gap. If price closes past the 50% mark of these zones, it often invalidates the expected reaction.
* Regular Trading Hour (RTH) and Electronic Trading Hour (ETH)
** This is the primary US session. You will see high volume, tighter spreads, and the most significant price moves, especially when major economic news is released.
** ETH (Extended/Electronic Trading Hours) is the overnight, Asian, and European sessions. You will generally see lower volume, wider spreads, and choppy or quiet price action. Volatility can spike briefly, especially after major Asian or European news.
*** The price movement during the period outside of RTH—specifically from 4:00 PM (16:00) ET to 9:30 AM ET the next day—is what creates the potential RTH gap.
*** RTH open at 9:30 ET with opening price of the high-volume cash market. 
*** RTH Close at 4:00 PM ET; The closing price of the high-volume cash market session.
*** ETH/Overnight Session from 4:00 PM ET to 9:30 AM ET; The low-volume trading that occurs while the cash market is closed. Price discovery here is "less liquid."
** The gap is the difference between the RTH Close (4:00 PM) and the RTH Open (9:30 AM)
** The Role of RTH Price Action
*** Re-testing/Filling ETH Gaps: The ETH gap represents a low-volume, potentially inefficient move. When the high-volume RTH opens, the market may see the gap area as a zone of imbalance (or Fair Value Gap/FVG) that needs to be traded through or "filled" to achieve greater efficiency before continuing the original move. This is a key trading principle for many strategies.
*** Addressing Liquidity Pools: Liquidity pools (often located just above significant swing highs/double tops or below significant swing lows/double bottoms) represent concentrated resting orders (stop-losses or pending orders). RTH price action is frequently driven by large institutions looking to "sweep" or "run" these liquidity pools to fuel their own large entries or exits.
*** Reacting to News of the Day: Economic data releases (e.g., CPI, FOMC minutes, NFP), earnings reports, and geopolitical events are typically released either before the RTH open or during the RTH session. These announcements are the primary fundamental catalysts that provide the necessary energy and institutional conviction to drive price through established support/resistance levels and, importantly, confirm or reject the direction of the overnight ETH move.
*** Imbalances and Fair Value Gaps (FVG): Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and other imbalances are specific footprints of institutional participation. During RTH, the high volume provides the market structure to either immediately close an FVG (an efficient move) or to create a new, larger FVG (a strong directional conviction). The RTH is the most reliable time to trade these institutional concepts.
*** In essence, the ETH gap sets the stage, while liquidity, fundamental news, and institutional imbalances (FVG) provide the engine and the targets for the ensuing price action during the RTH.
* ICT One Trade Setup for Life (Liquidity-Based Outline)
** Core Principle: Draw on Liquidity
*** Main driving force of the market: Liquidity.
*** Two types of liquidity pools:
**** Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL): Stops resting below old lows, support zones, and session range lows.
**** Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL): Stops resting above old highs, resistance zones, and session range highs.
*** Price is constantly seeking these pools, sweeping one side to fuel moves to the opposite side.
** Daily PM Session Range (1:30–4:00 PM NY Local Time)
*** Define the range: Highest high and lowest low between 1:30–4:00 PM.
*** Bullish day logic:
**** First, target Sell-Side Liquidity (SSL) → sweep the lows.
**** Then, expand higher toward Buy-Side Liquidity (BSL) → target the highs.
*** PM range acts as a roadmap for the following trading sessions.
** London Session Raid (2:00–5:00 AM Local Time)
*** Identify London session high/low (liquidity zones).
*** At NY Open (9:30 AM):
**** If NY open is above London’s BSL, then target London SSL (downside raid).
**** If NY open is below London’s SSL, then target London BSL (upside raid).
*** This creates the AM directional bias into RTH.
** Regular Trading Hours (RTH) (4:14–9:30 AM NY Local Time)
*** RTH logic revolves around the closing gap (prior day’s close vs. RTH open).
**** If price opens below closing gap and sweeps Sell-Side Liquidity,
**** In the afternoon, expect price to rally into Buy-Side Liquidity.
**** If price opens above closing gap and sweeps Buy-Side Liquidity,
**** In the afternoon, expect price to fall into Sell-Side Liquidity.
** New York Lunch Raid (12:00–1:30 PM)
*** Lunch session is a liquidity trap zone.
*** Logic:
**** If price is below SSL, target BSL.
**** If price is above BSL, target SSL.
**** Bearish day filter:
**** Wait for a run up into the Opening Gap.
**** Hunt Lunch Buy-Side Liquidity, then shift bias toward Sell-Side Liquidity below.
** AM Session Ranges (9:30 AM–12:00 Noon NY Local Time)
*** AM session targets the previous high or low of AM or PM ranges.
*** RTH levels are respected — next day’s price action often raids the prior day’s AM/PM session liquidity.
*** If AM is choppy or directionless, do not force trades.
*** Instead, wait for PM session at 1:30 PM for clearer setups.
** Trade Filtering Logic (One Trade a Day)
*** London Bias: Define raid direction (BSL or SSL).
*** NY AM Session: Confirm by sweep + structure shift.
*** RTH / Lunch / PM Range: Execute on the cleanest liquidity raid that aligns with the higher bias.
*** Risk Management: Stop beyond raid extreme; target opposite liquidity pool.
*** Only one trade needed per day if following liquidity path from session to session.
* Suspension Block
** “Isolated candlestick” → This means the candle is standing apart contextually (it’s not part of a cluster, and it has a distinct role).
** If there’s an FVG on both sides of the candle, that candle becomes “suspended” between two gaps.
** Algorithm letter comes to it → That’s your way of saying the algorithm recognizes it as a reference point. Price might return to it because it is balanced between inefficiencies.
** A single candle positioned between an FVG above and an FVG below, acting as a reference point where price may gravitate back because it represents a balanced or suspended state in an otherwise imbalanced structure.
*** Think of it like this:
*** The market leaves inefficiencies both ways.
*** The isolated candle becomes the anchor between them.
*** When algorithms “read” this, they might treat that block as a temporary equilibrium level that price later revisits.
* Long Wicks
** Wicks represent unfilled or imbalanced trading.
*** A wick (upper or lower shadow of a candle) shows that price moved into that area but didn’t stay there.
*** The body of the candle closed away from that wick, which suggests there wasn’t enough buying/selling pressure to hold price there.
** Algorithms treat that as unfinished business (like a gap).
*** Just like a “fair value gap” (FVG) marks an imbalance in trading (where one side dominated), wicks also show imbalance.
*** So to the algorithm, a long wick = an area where price didn’t get properly traded/auctioned.
*** In other words, price “skipped over” that zone quickly, almost like a small gap in liquidity.
** Practical meaning for traders:
*** Algorithms (and traders who follow them) may expect price to revisit those wick areas to “rebalance” liquidity.
**** A long downside wick might later get filled as price trades back down.
**** A long upside wick might get revisited from above.
* The ICT Breaker Block is primarily known as a reversal pattern, but it can also be used in a continuation context, especially when viewed across multiple timeframes.
** Primarily a Reversal Pattern (Market Structure Shift)
*** The classic Breaker setup signals a change in the intermediate or short-term trend, which is why it is famous as a reversal pattern:
*** The Setup: A Breaker is created when a swing point (which was initially a valid Order Block) fails to hold price and is broken through, causing a Market Structure Shift (MSS).
** The Reversal: The price action confirms a reversal. For instance, in a bullish breaker, the market fails to make a new lower low after running liquidity, reverses, and breaks a previous swing high, indicating the sellers are now trapped and the trend has flipped to the upside.
*** Key Concept: The Breaker block zone (the failed Order Block) acts as the entry point for the new direction, which is a reversal of the recent swing.
** Can Act as a Continuation Tool (High-Timeframe Context)
*** While the Breaker itself causes a reversal of the immediate price swing, it often serves as a continuation or re-entry point in the context of the higher-timeframe trend or a larger overall bias.
*** Continuation Example: Imagine the Daily chart is clearly in a strong uptrend.
*** Price starts a healthy correction (a pullback on the 4H chart).
*** This pullback on the 4H chart creates a setup where a Bullish Breaker forms (e.g., a small stop run below an old low, followed by a Market Structure Shift back up).
*** When the 4H Breaker is traded, you are entering the market as a reversal of the recent 4-hour pullback, but a continuation of the long-term Daily uptrend.
*** In summary:
**** The Breaker is a Reversal of the immediate, local price swing that created it (e.g., reversing the move that swept the liquidity).
**** The Breaker is a Continuation if that reversal aligns with and continues the dominant trend observed on a higher timeframe.
* Key Components of the ICT Unicorn Model
** Breaker Block (BB): A former Order Block that failed to hold as support/resistance and was broken through, now expected to serve the opposite role. For example, a broken bullish order block becomes a bearish breaker block.
** Fair Value Gap (FVG): A three-candle pattern that shows a price imbalance where the first and third candles' wicks don't overlap. Price is often expected to return to this "gap" to fill the inefficiency.
** Unicorn Zone: The area of overlap where the Breaker Block and Fair Value Gap coincide. This confluence is what makes the setup a "Unicorn" (a rare, high-quality entry).
** The setup is usually sought after a shift in market structure, and the trading entry is typically placed when the price returns (retests) this "Unicorn Zone" of confluence.
* Reason for Market Movement
** Market moves to hunt liquidity
*** Concept: The market seeks areas where stop-loss orders are clustered. This usually means above swing highs or below swing lows, where retail traders often place stops.
*** Reason: Smart money (institutions, banks) need liquidity to execute large orders without leaving huge footprints. They “hunt” these areas to fill their positions efficiently.
** Market moves to rebalance inefficiencies
*** Concept: Inefficiencies are gaps, imbalances, or areas where price moved too quickly without proper order flow.
*** Reason: The market likes smooth order flow. These “inefficient” areas are often Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)—zones where institutions left unfilled orders.
** Market moves to rebalance equilibrium
*** Concept: Equilibrium refers to the market’s fair value or mean price in an area. Often, price oscillates around an equilibrium point in a consolidation.
*** Reason: After an imbalance or excessive deviation, the market seeks to bring price back to a fair value where buyers and sellers are in relative agreement.
*** Example: Price rallies too far above a consolidation range. The market often retraces toward the middle of the range (equilibrium) before making the next directional move.
*** Keywords: value area, mean reversion, consolidation midpoint.
** Market moves to create liquidity
*** Concept: The market sometimes creates opportunities to generate liquidity, often by moving price to areas where traders have positions.
*** Reason: Smart money wants to enter positions with enough liquidity available. Sometimes, it induces traders to take the wrong side first to “create” the liquidity needed.
*** Example: Price dips slightly below a support, enticing retail traders to short. These shorts provide the liquidity smart money needs to buy aggressively, causing price to reverse upward.
*** Keywords: inducement, liquidity creation, stop-hunting, smart money positioning.
** How these ideas connect
*** Hunt liquidity → create liquidity: These are the most aggressive moves by smart money to fill orders.
*** Rebalance inefficiencies → rebalance equilibrium: These are more corrective moves to ensure smooth market flow and fair pricing.
*** All together: Price is rarely random. Smart money orchestrates moves that hunt liquidity, create liquidity, and correct inefficiencies while keeping equilibrium as the “center of gravity.”

* Equilibrium
** Equilibrium as a Midway Point
*** Definition: The equilibrium is the midpoint of the price range defined by the most recent Swing Low and the most recent Swing High.
*** Significance: It serves as a dividing line for value.
*** In a bullish trend, the area above equilibrium (50%) is considered the Premium zone (expensive for buyers), and the area below equilibrium is the Discount zone (cheap for buyers).
*** Traders following this approach wait for the price to retrace (pull back) into the Discount zone (below the 50% Equilibrium level) during an uptrend to look for a buy entry. The market is considered "fair value" at the equilibrium line itself.
** Determining the Swing High and The Setup
*** The strategy uses a specific, four-candle pattern to confirm the formation of the Swing High that marks the end of the initial rally and the start of the pullback (retracement).
*** The setup for confirming a Swing High is:
**** Candle 1 (Left): A candle with a high price.
**** Candle 2 (Center/Highest): The candle with the absolute highest high price in the immediate sequence. This candle forms the Swing High peak.
**** Candle 3 (Right): A candle with a lower high than the center candle.
**** Candle 4 (Confirmation): A final candle that confirms the shift in momentum by showing price going lower (a lower close/body, or a definitive drop from the high).
**** Once this four-candle swing high is formed, it establishes the top of your price range (the "Swing High" point) for measuring the Equilibrium. This is a common method in technical analysis to objectively define a swing point, regardless of the time frame.
** The Trading Principle
*** After identifying the Swing Low and Swing High of the most recent price move, the strategy follows these steps:
*** Initial Rally: The price moves from a low point and rallies up, forming the Swing High using the four-candle confirmation pattern.
*** Wait for Retracement: The rally ends, and the price begins to retrace (pull back/come down).
*** Target Entry Zone: The trader waits for the price to drop back to or below the Equilibrium (50%) level into the Discount zone. This area is considered a favorable price to buy for a continuation of the bullish trend, as the price is "cheap" relative to the full move.
*** Buy: Once the price reaches the equilibrium or the Discount zone, the trader looks for a confirmation (like a bullish candlestick or other technical signal) to enter a long (buy) position, anticipating the trend will resume and push the price to new highs.
**   The same process holds for bearish setup
* ICT Propulsion Block
** The Core Structure (Order Block Interaction)
*** A Propulsion Block is characterized by its interaction with a prior Order Block (OB). It's a single candlestick that performs a quick retest of the Order Block and then drives the price with momentum in the opposite direction.
** Bullish Propulsion Block
*** A bullish PB is the last bearish (down-closed) candlestick in a strong uptrend that:
**** Trades into an existing Bullish Order Block.
**** Immediately triggers a strong upward price movement (displacement), confirming the Order Block's validity.
**** Trading use: When price later retraces back to this specific bullish candlestick, it is expected to act as a highly sensitive support zone, causing a sharp reversal to the upside.
** Bearish Propulsion Block
*** A bearish PB is the last bullish (up-closed) candlestick in a strong downtrend that:
**** Trades into an existing Bearish Order Block.
**** Immediately triggers a strong downward price movement (displacement), confirming the Order Block's validity.
**** Trading use: When price later retraces back to this specific bearish candlestick, it is expected to act as a highly sensitive resistance zone, causing a sharp reversal to the downside.
** Key Validation Criteria (Mean Threshold)
*** For a Propulsion Block to be considered valid, its Mean Threshold (MT) is a critical factor:
*** The Mean Threshold is the 50% retracement level of the Propulsion Block candlestick's body or range (from high to low/low to high).
*** During the retest of the Propulsion Block, the price should not close beyond the Mean Threshold of the Propulsion Block candle. If price breaks or closes past this 50% mark, the block's integrity is compromised, and it is no longer considered a high-probability trade setup.
*** By respecting the Mean Threshold, the Propulsion Block acts as a tighter, more precise entry point than the entire Order Block zone, allowing traders to execute trades with minimal drawdown and a small stop-loss, which results in a high reward-to-risk ratio.
* The Logic of the Reclaimed Order Block and Dealing Range
*** Reclaimed Order Block (OB) Definition: A Reclaimed OB is an Order Block that was initially violated or "broken" by price, appearing to be invalidated. However, price then returns to the zone, respects it, and continues in the original direction, reclaiming the zone as a valid Point of Interest (POI). This often suggests institutional traders have accumulated or distributed orders in that zone.
*** The Dealing Range: In the ICT methodology, the Dealing Range is the current, active Swing High and Swing Low. The market is expected to move from one side of the range (a discount/premium Price Delivery Array) to the other (liquidity at the opposite swing high/low).
** The High/Low Not Taken Condition (Liquidity):
*** If the price does not take out the high or low of the current dealing range before returning to the broken Order Block, it means the liquidity at that high or low is still intact.
*** This intact liquidity becomes the primary target for the move after the order block is reclaimed.
** Conclusion
*** A Reclaimed Order Block is often a more powerful setup when the Dealing Range high (in a bullish scenario) or low (in a bearish scenario) has not been taken.
*** This leaves a clean, uncleared liquidity pool (an external liquidity target) for the market to move toward, giving the trade a high-probability target and clear objective.
*** The market has completed the institutional accumulation phase (the reclaim) and is now poised to run to the next major area of liquidity (the dealing range high/low).
* The Logic of Inversion/Reclaimed Fair Value Gap (IFVG)
** The concept of a "reclaimed" FVG aligns with the Inversion Fair Value Gap (IFVG).
*** An IFVG occurs when price violates an existing FVG by trading and closing completely through it. This suggests a shift in market momentum.
*** The former FVG then "flips" its role: a violated bullish FVG becomes new resistance (bearish IFVG), and a violated bearish FVG becomes new support (bullish IFVG).
*** The relationship to the dealing range is often used to give context to this shift. For a true shift in market structure and a highly probable trade setup, the FVG inversion is often accompanied by or occurs shortly after a liquidity sweep (taking a swing high or low).
** So the logic of reclaimed fvg is different from reclaimed ob.
