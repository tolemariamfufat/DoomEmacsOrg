** I now see that MMXM is just PO3 applied to market structure. The 'Original Consolidation' is the Accumulation, the 'Run to HTF PD Array' is the Manipulation, and the 'Run to the Buy-Side/Sell-Side Curve' is the Distribution. It’s all one singular algorithmic cycle repeating at different timeframes.
** I am now tracking the Weekly Market Maker Buy Model (MMBM). Today's 9:30 AM drop was the weekly Manipulation leg. Since price has now shifted structure and returned to the 'Buy-side of the Curve,' I am looking for the market to treat the 25,900 area as a stepping stone to reach the All-Time High before the week ends.
** Because the Tuesday SMR (Smart Money Reversal) occurred at 9:30 AM at 25,811, I am now operating under the Weekly Market Maker Buy Model. I will not look for deep sells anymore. I will treat every dip into today's 10:00 AM 'Silver Bullet' FVG as a high-probability re-entry for the run to 26,288.
** I’m looking for the 'Initial Accumulation'—the horizontal box from Monday. I'm not just looking for a single high point; I'm looking for the zone where the market makers first gathered their positions. Today's expansion is the 'Buy-side of the Curve' aiming to completely invalidate that entire Monday range.
** I have mapped the entire hierarchy. My Micro Bias is the 9:30 AM Judas Swing at 25,811. My Weekly Bias is the MMXM aiming for 26,288. And my Macro Safety Net is the Consequent Encroachment of the NWOG at 25,495. I am now watching the 10:00 AM Silver Bullet window to see if the market stays above the Midnight Open to confirm the 'Run to ATH' is the priority.
** The 25,811 reversal is secondary. The Primary Magnet (25,495/25,414) remains unswept. Therefore, any run to 26,288 is a 'Protracted Manipulation.' I will not fall in love with the bullishness; I am looking for the Smart Money to 'hand over' their positions at the ATH to unsuspecting retail buyers.

** Wicks don't matter for CISD. If the body closes 1 tick above the open of the previous bearish candle, the sell-program is over. I am now looking for a Fair Value Gap to form as the 'Engine' for the new direction.
** I do not chase the first impulsive candle. I wait for the 'Test of Strength.' If the market can't hold its own midpoint, the move is a lie. The Change in State of Delivery is only real when the body definitively 'swallows' the previous open after a successful defense of the 50% level.

** I now have five styles to look for: The Rejection Wick, the Big Pair, the Three-Drive Exhaustion, the Breaker Flip, and the SFP Body Reclaim. I will categorize every reversal I see into one of these five buckets to see which one the current algorithm prefers.

** The "Seek and Destroy" Signature
*** The Balanced Start: Price spent the morning (London and Pre-Market) oscillating around the Midnight Open (25,751). It went low (25,542) and then high (25,794), but by 9:30 AM, it was essentially "home" again.
*** Expansion in Both Directions: In a Seek and Destroy profile, the market will sweep the Buy Side Liquidity (BSL) and the Sell Side Liquidity (SSL) multiple times. It doesn't want to leave any stops untouched.
*** The Consolidation Trap: After 9:30 AM, price traded between 25,832 and 25,713. This range is designed to "induce" traders. It looks like it's breaking out to the upside, so people buy; then it reverses and sweeps the lows, so people sell.
** Key Takeaways for your Rules
*** If Price = MO at 9:30 AM: Expect a "Z-Day" or Seek and Destroy. This is usually the lowest probability day for a trend trader.
*** No Displacement: If you see "choppy" moves that take out a high and then immediately take out a low without leaving a clean Fair Value Gap (FVG), you are in S&D.
*** The Best Action: On these days, the "model" is often to do nothing. As ICT says, "The best trade is sometimes the one you don't take."
** Why it happened today
*** Since today (Jan 28, 2026) was an FOMC day, the market almost always goes into "Seek and Destroy" mode during the morning session. The big institutions are waiting for the 2:00 PM news, so the morning is just "noise" to trap retail liquidity before the real move.
