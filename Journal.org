** I now see that MMXM is just PO3 applied to market structure. The 'Original Consolidation' is the Accumulation, the 'Run to HTF PD Array' is the Manipulation, and the 'Run to the Buy-Side/Sell-Side Curve' is the Distribution. It’s all one singular algorithmic cycle repeating at different timeframes.
** I am now tracking the Weekly Market Maker Buy Model (MMBM). Today's 9:30 AM drop was the weekly Manipulation leg. Since price has now shifted structure and returned to the 'Buy-side of the Curve,' I am looking for the market to treat the 25,900 area as a stepping stone to reach the All-Time High before the week ends.
** Because the Tuesday SMR (Smart Money Reversal) occurred at 9:30 AM at 25,811, I am now operating under the Weekly Market Maker Buy Model. I will not look for deep sells anymore. I will treat every dip into today's 10:00 AM 'Silver Bullet' FVG as a high-probability re-entry for the run to 26,288.
** I’m looking for the 'Initial Accumulation'—the horizontal box from Monday. I'm not just looking for a single high point; I'm looking for the zone where the market makers first gathered their positions. Today's expansion is the 'Buy-side of the Curve' aiming to completely invalidate that entire Monday range.
** I have mapped the entire hierarchy. My Micro Bias is the 9:30 AM Judas Swing at 25,811. My Weekly Bias is the MMXM aiming for 26,288. And my Macro Safety Net is the Consequent Encroachment of the NWOG at 25,495. I am now watching the 10:00 AM Silver Bullet window to see if the market stays above the Midnight Open to confirm the 'Run to ATH' is the priority.
** The 25,811 reversal is secondary. The Primary Magnet (25,495/25,414) remains unswept. Therefore, any run to 26,288 is a 'Protracted Manipulation.' I will not fall in love with the bullishness; I am looking for the Smart Money to 'hand over' their positions at the ATH to unsuspecting retail buyers.

** Wicks don't matter for CISD. If the body closes 1 tick above the open of the previous bearish candle, the sell-program is over. I am now looking for a Fair Value Gap to form as the 'Engine' for the new direction.
** I do not chase the first impulsive candle. I wait for the 'Test of Strength.' If the market can't hold its own midpoint, the move is a lie. The Change in State of Delivery is only real when the body definitively 'swallows' the previous open after a successful defense of the 50% level.

** I now have five styles to look for: The Rejection Wick, the Big Pair, the Three-Drive Exhaustion, the Breaker Flip, and the SFP Body Reclaim. I will categorize every reversal I see into one of these five buckets to see which one the current algorithm prefers.

** The "Seek and Destroy" Signature
*** The Balanced Start: Price spent the morning (London and Pre-Market) oscillating around the Midnight Open (25,751). It went low (25,542) and then high (25,794), but by 9:30 AM, it was essentially "home" again.
*** Expansion in Both Directions: In a Seek and Destroy profile, the market will sweep the Buy Side Liquidity (BSL) and the Sell Side Liquidity (SSL) multiple times. It doesn't want to leave any stops untouched.
*** The Consolidation Trap: After 9:30 AM, price traded between 25,832 and 25,713. This range is designed to "induce" traders. It looks like it's breaking out to the upside, so people buy; then it reverses and sweeps the lows, so people sell.
** Key Takeaways for your Rules
*** If Price = MO at 9:30 AM: Expect a "Z-Day" or Seek and Destroy. This is usually the lowest probability day for a trend trader.
*** No Displacement: If you see "choppy" moves that take out a high and then immediately take out a low without leaving a clean Fair Value Gap (FVG), you are in S&D.
*** The Best Action: On these days, the "model" is often to do nothing. As ICT says, "The best trade is sometimes the one you don't take."
** Why it happened today
*** Since today (Jan 28, 2026) was an FOMC day, the market almost always goes into "Seek and Destroy" mode during the morning session. The big institutions are waiting for the 2:00 PM news, so the morning is just "noise" to trap retail liquidity before the real move.
** Why you should wait (The "No Entry" Rules)
*** Trend is King: If the higher timeframe (HTF) trend is bullish, the algorithm is in a "Buy Program." A 1m rejection and a small FVG are often just the market "creating a wick" or seeking a discount to buy more.
*** Inducement vs. Reversal: That small 1m FVG is likely an inducement. The market creates a small bearish sign to trick retail traders into selling, only to run their stops as it continues the bullish trend.
*** Internal vs. External: If you haven't swept a major External Range Liquidity (ERL) level (like a previous session high), a 1m shift is very low probability.
** How to handle this specific scenario
*** If the trend is bullish and you see a 1m rejection:
*** Don't Sell: Instead, look at that 1m bearish FVG as a "Target" for a retracement.
*** The "Buy" Model: Wait for price to trade down through that bearish FVG. If price pulls back, hits a Discount PD Array (like a bullish Order Block or the 50% Equilibrium), and then shows a bullish sign, that is your entry to go Long.
*** Inversion FVG: If price trades back up and closes above that 1m bearish FVG, it becomes an Inversion FVG—a very strong support level for a bullish continuation.
** A 1-minute FVG against the trend is a speed bump, not a brick wall. Do not trade against the HTF trend unless the market has cleared major liquidity and shifted structure with displacement.
** The "Bullish Only" Model
*** If the trend is bullish, your trade management should look like this:
*** The Entry: Wait for a retracement into a Discount zone (below 50% of your anchored range) or a Bullish PD Array (Order Block or FVG).
*** The Take Profits (TP):
*** TP1: The first Internal Range High (recent swing high).
*** TP2: The External Range Liquidity (the major high of your range).
*** TP3: The "Unfinished Business" (your target at 25,899).
** When can you ever go short in a bullish trend?
*** There is only one scenario where ICT suggests a counter-trend short, and even then, it is for advanced traders:
*** ERL is Swept: Price hits a major HTF target (like a Daily or Weekly high).
*** Market Structure Shift (MSS): You see a clear shift on a lower timeframe with heavy displacement (multiple 5m or 15m bearish candles).
*** The Objective: You aren't "reversing the trend"; you are simply trading the retracement back down to the 50% Equilibrium or a Bullish FVG.
*** Rule of Thumb: If you are a beginner or intermediate, ignore the shorts. It is much easier and more profitable to catch a 50-point move in the direction of the trend than a 10-point move against it.
** Why we treat Bearish FVGs as "Targets," not "Entries"
*** When the trend is bullish:
*** Bearish FVG = A Magnet: Price will pull back into it. You don't sell it; you wait for price to reach it and then look for a Bullish reversal to go long.
*** Inversion: If price runs above a bearish FVG and stays there, it is a massive signal that the trend is very strong. This is an Inversion FVG, and it now acts as a floor for more buying.
** In a Bullish Trend, I am a Discount Buyer. I do not sell Premium unless a Major HTF level is hit and confirmed by a structural shift. My bearish FVGs are where I look to take profits or re-enter longs, not where I enter shorts.
** Institutional Sponsorship versus Retail Pattern Recognition.
*** The "Mean Threshold" Rule (The 50% Filter)
**** In ICT, a bullish Order Block or Breaker is only valid as long as the price does not close below its 50% level (Mean Threshold).
**** The Error: Placing your stop loss too tight, right at the top of the block.
**** The Fix: If the price trades into your entry zone and starts "hanging around" the bottom half of the candle, it is no longer a high-probability setup. Institutions protect the 50% mark. If it closes below that 50%, the "deep retracement" you fear is actually a Market Structure Shift in disguise.
*** SMT Divergence (The "Unseen" Confirmation)
**** If you are trading USTech (NQ), you must look at the S&P 500 (ES) at the same time.
**** The Trap: NQ sweeps a low and starts moving up, so you enter. But ES failed to sweep its corresponding low.
**** The Lesson: This is a "crack in correlation." If one asset sweeps and the other doesn't, the one that didn't sweep is often the real trend. If you enter on the sweep without checking the other asset, you are often catching a "fake" move that will inevitably reverse for a deeper run.
*** Seek and Destroy vs. Trend
**** Recall your lesson on Seek and Destroy. On days where the price is balanced around the Midnight Open at 9:30 AM, the "stop hunt" you see is often just the first half of the trap.
**** The Behavior: S&D profiles are designed to sweep the low, move up (inducing you to buy), and then immediately reverse to sweep the high, then back to the low.
**** The Fix: On S&D days, don't trade the first stop hunt. Wait for the market to sweep both sides of the morning range before looking for a late-session expansion.
*** How to Place a "Professional" Stop Loss
**** Tight Stop-high Risk-Placed right at the bottom of a 1m FVG. Easily hit by "noise."
**** Structural Stop-Medium Risk-Placed below the Mean Threshold (50%) of the 5m Order Block.
**** Institutional Stop-Low Risk-Placed below the Swing Low that created the displacement. If this level breaks, your entire "Long" thesis is officially wrong.
*** When the price turns back for a "deep retracement" after you enter, look at the speed.
**** Slow drift down: This is a rebalance; stay in the trade.
**** Fast "Slam" down: This is a change in state of delivery. Exit manually before it hits your stop. The algorithm has shifted.
** A target is only as strong as the timeframe it lives on. If a 15-minute 'Fair Value' level stands in the way of a 1-minute 'Liquidity' level, the Fair Value usually wins.
** Institutional Order Flow
*** The ERL $\rightleftarrows$ IRL RuleThe most fundamental rule ICT teaches is that price only moves between two points:
*** External Range Liquidity (ERL): Major Highs and Lows.Internal Range Liquidity (IRL): Fair Value Gaps (FVG).
**** The Cycle: After price sweeps ERL (a stop hunt), its next magnetic target is IRL (the FVG you entered on). Once it hits that IRL, its next magnetic target is the Opposing ERL.
** High Resistance vs. Low Resistance Liquidity Runs
*** This is the rule that explains why price sometimes "passes one or two stop hunts unexpectedly."
*** Low Resistance Liquidity Run (LRLR) — The "Runner"
*** If the market has "Unfinished Business" and the path is clear, it will slice through stop hunts like butter.
*** The Signature: Large, energetic candles with very small wicks.
*** The Rule: If price creates Relative Equal Highs or Relative Equal Lows, the algorithm views this as "Low Resistance." It will not stop at the first high; it will run through all of them in one surge to reach the "true" pool of money.
** High Resistance Liquidity Run (HRLR) — The "Grind"
*** If the market is moving into a zone where institutions are heavily "absorbing" orders, the move will be slow and messy.
*** The Signature: Overlapping candles, many wicks, and frequent small retracements.
*** The Rule: In an HRLR, you should take profits at TP1 (the first internal high) because the market is likely to reverse and "Deep Retrace" before ever reaching TP2.
** The "State of Delivery" Rule
*** Check your Higher Timeframe (HTF).
*** Rule: If the Daily/4-hour chart has just tapped a Discount Order Block, the 1m/5m "stop hunts" on the way up will be ignored by the price. The market is in a "Seeking ERL" state, and it will run through every minor resistance until it hits the major HTF high.
*** Reversal Rule: If price has already hit its HTF Target, any 1m/5m bullish move you take is high-risk. It will likely reverse before hitting your "stop hunt" target because the "Big Money" has already exited.
** The "Priority of Fair Value" Rule
*** In the ICT hierarchy, Higher Timeframe (HTF) Internal Range Liquidity (IRL) usually takes priority over Lower Timeframe (LTF) External Range Liquidity (ERL).
*** The Trap: You enter on a 1m FVG and target a 1m swing high (BSL).
*** The Reality: Price moves up, but it slams into a 15m Bearish FVG (a horizontal zone of resistance) just before reaching your 1m target.
*** The Result: The algorithm considers the market "rebalanced" once it hits that 15m FVG. It has fulfilled its higher-level purpose, so it no longer needs to reach that tiny 1m stop hunt. It reverses, and you get caught wondering why it "turned

** Internal Candlestick Pullbacks (ICT "Liquidity Sweeps")
*** The Video Says: A valid internal pullback happens when a candle sweeps the low of a previous impulse candle [04:50].
*** ICT Connection: This is exactly how ICT explains Price Action and Liquidity. A move isn't just a move; it must "take something" to be valid. ICT teaches that the market moves from liquidity to liquidity. When a candle takes the low of a previous candle, it is a "mini stop hunt" that provides the fuel for the next leg.
** The 38.2% Fibonacci Rule (ICT "Discount/Premium")
*** A structural pullback must reach at least the 38.
*** ICT uses the 50% Equilibrium level as his primary filter. While this video uses 38.2% as a "minimum," the logic is the same: Do not buy in Premium and do not sell in Discount. ICT teaches that a high-probability "Optimal Trade Entry" (OTE) happens between 62% and 79%. Both systems agree that a move that doesn't retrace deep enough is just "internal noise" or "engineered liquidity" [07:30].
** Sweeping Pullbacks (ICT "Inducement")
*** The most powerful pullback is one that creates equal highs/lows and then sweeps them right before hitting an Order Block [12:06].
*** This is a classic ICT Inducement. The market creates "Retail Support" (Equal Lows) to trick traders into buying. Then, the algorithm sweeps those stops (the "Sweeping Pullback") into a higher-timeframe Order Block before the real move starts.
** Validating Points of Interest (POIs)
*** An Order Block or FVG is only "high quality" if it was created by a leg that had a valid structural pullback [08:53].
*** This aligns with Institutional Sponsorship. ICT teaches that not every FVG is tradable. You want to see "Displacement" that leaves behind a gap after a liquidity hunt. The video’s "mechanical rules" for pullbacks are just a different way of ensuring the move you are trading has real institutional weight behind it.
** I will not treat a sideways move as a pullback. I need to see a candle low swept (Internal) or a move to the 38.2%-50% level (Structural) before I consider my Order Block or FVG valid for entr
** In a bullish move, candles are making higher highs and higher lows. To the algorithm, the "trend" on that specific timeframe hasn't paused until a candle's low is taken out.
*** The Impulse: Candle 1, 2, and 3 all have higher lows. The move is "clean."
*** The Validation: Candle 4's high is the "Current High." If Candle 5 trades below the low of Candle 4, the Internal Pullback is now valid.
*** The Trap: If price just moves sideways (inside bars) without taking that low, the "impulse leg" is technically still active.
** How this fits with ICT logic
*** Stop Hunting at the Micro Level: Every time a candle low is swept in an uptrend, the market is grabbing "Internal Range Liquidity" to fuel the next push up.
*** The "Change in State of Delivery": If you are in a bullish trend and a candle finally sweeps a previous low, ICT looks for the next candle to close back above the high of the "sweeping" candle. This confirms the pullback is over and the trend is resuming.
** A pullback isn't just price moving down; it's price taking liquidity from the previous candle. This validates the high. If the HTF trend is bullish, I expect this 'internal sweep' to hold and lead to a new high.
** I will not enter a long just because a low was swept. I will wait for a Candle Close above the high of the candle that did the sweeping. This is my 'Green Light' that the algorithm has finished its discount and is ready to expand again.
** Engineered Liquidity
** The "Chain" of Sweeps: Why it happens
*** When price passes through the most recent short-term sweep low to hit a preceding structural sweep low, it’s doing what’s called deep mitigation.
*** The First Sweep (The Bait): Price takes out a candle low. This looks like the "pullback" is starting, but it doesn't have enough "fuel" (orders) to reverse the whole trend yet.
*** The Second Sweep (The Liquidity Run): Price continues lower to sweep a major Swing Low or a Structural Low. This is where the "Big Money" resting orders are actually sitting.
*** The Goal: By taking out multiple levels of lows, the market clears out everyone who put their stop losses "too tight" on the first pullback.
** How to handle this in your trading
*** If you observe price sweeping multiple lows, don't panic and think the trend is dead. Instead, use these two filters:
*** Look for the HTF PD Array: Is there a Higher Timeframe Fair Value Gap (FVG) or Order Block sitting just below that second sweep low? If yes, the market is likely just reaching for that "higher quality" zone before reversing.
*** The "Double Sweep" Confirmation: A "Double Sweep" (taking a short-term low and a structural low) is actually a higher probability setup than a single sweep. It shows the market has completely cleaned the books.
** Pro Tip: If price sweeps the first low and then stagnates or moves sideways, expect it to run the second low. Smart money likes to "engineer" those equal-ish lows to make retail traders feel safe buying there, only to sweep them all at once.
** I will not be fooled by the first sweep. If there is a cleaner structural low or an HTF FVG just below, I will wait for price to reach into that 'True Discount' before looking for my Change in State of Delivery.
